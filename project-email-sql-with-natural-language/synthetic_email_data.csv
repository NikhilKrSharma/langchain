Dear Emily,

Following our recent meeting, I am pleased to inform you that the proposal for the expansion of our data center infrastructure has been approved. The project involves the acquisition of additional server racks and networking equipment from CloudTech Solutions, a trusted vendor in the industry.

The estimated cost for this expansion project is $350,000, which will be allocated from the IT budget for the current fiscal year. The detailed project plan, including timelines and resource allocation, has been attached for your review. We anticipate that this expansion will enhance our data processing capabilities and support the growing demands of our digital services.

Please review the attached document and provide any feedback or suggestions by the end of the week. Once we receive your approval, we will proceed with initiating the procurement process and scheduling the installation with our IT team.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Alex

Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

Can you resend the email version which Salt River sent to you?

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Kim:

Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

Can you resend the email version which Salt River sent to you?

Jay and/or Tracy:  Who will prepare credit?

Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

Thanks,

Kim

I would like to begin working on an ISDA, I have attached our standard form

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Mary,

HPLC executed a gas purchase agreement with CCGM, LP effective 7/1/2000.  
HPLC secured the purchase of production from the Briscoe #1 well in Webb 
county for 12 months; the producer of this well is Hoover Oil & Gas, Inc.  A 
tap and meter for this production was set on the Big Cowboy system and this 
gas now flows to the Exxon King Ranch plant.

I agree that this gas should be scheduled on Big Cowboy (GEPL) and not HPLC.  
I erroneously nominated this gas on HPLC for the month of October; however, 
did not do so for the month of November.

Hopefully this is useful information!

EDS Insourcing Update<<<
SUBJECT END>>>

<<<BODY START>>>
I have another meeting with Phil Clark (EDS) on Wednesday, 3/8.  According to 
Steve, who will probably not be at this meeting since his name is now on the 
""official list"", these are the outstanding items:

I have offiered $5000 finders fee per person, Phil would like more.  Our 
economic analysis assumed a $10k finders fee, so we are still within that 
limit.
EDS definitely wants the contract minimums for 2001 and 2002 increased.  I 
will offer $8mm for both years, an increase of $2mm in 2001 and $3mm in 
2002.  Again, I want to stress to them that they must EARN this additional 
work.  I am still playing phone tag with Ken Stott on this to see what Azurix 
plans for 2001 and 2002.  

Our orginal plan, which was quite agressive, targeted 4/1 as the transition 
date.  GIven that we are in the second week of March, I think a more 
realistic timeline for transition is 5/1.  This means the employee offers 
should be out no later than 4/1, with a yes/no answer back by 4/15.  Then 
actual transition of the ""yes"" employees will take place effective 5/1.  I 
think our initial ""yes"" response will be at 75%, but by the time 4/15 hits, 
that amount will be 90-95%.  In discussions with Steve, he thinks this is a 
realistic guess.

So, the next steps include:
Finishing up negotiations with EDS/Phil Clark.
Start developing a transition workplan/communication plan with HR (Robert 
Jones and Ben Herman).

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I'll provide another update 
after my meeting on Wednesday.

should be out no later than 4/1, with a yes/no answer back by 4/15.  Then 
actual transition of the ""yes"" employees will take place effective 5/1.  I 
think our initial ""yes"" response will be at 75%, but by the time 4/15 hits, 
that amount will be 90-95%.  In discussions with Steve, he thinks this is a 
realistic guess.

So, the next steps include:
Finishing up negotiations with EDS/Phil Clark.
Start developing a transition workplan/communication plan with HR (Robert 
Jones and Ben Herman).

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I'll provide another update 
after my meeting on Wednesday.

Thanks.   Jenny

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."" 
Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."" 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

Subject:	New Mexico Power Plant Project

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."" 
Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."" 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

John, I have sent you back our suggested changes to the NDA. If you agree,
then please send it back as final and we'll get it signed. As you can tell,
we removed section 5 since in the spirit of co-operation, this seems
inappropriate and a very unlikely circumstance.

Dear Emily,

Following our recent meeting, please find attached the proposal for the development of a new AI-driven cybersecurity software by CodeTech Solutions. This project is estimated to require 5000 hours of development work and a budget of $250,000. The software is expected to enhance our network security by implementing advanced threat detection algorithms and real-time monitoring capabilities.

Before proceeding, we need to ensure compliance with ISO 27001 standards for data security. Please review the proposal and provide feedback by the end of the week. CC: IT Security Team.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Latest NFL Player News

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against
the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch
a TD pass.

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis'
output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him
every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent
Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats
and may even find the end zone.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been
very soft all year long.

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is
still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a
weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use
him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use
their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander,
and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield
in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your
active lineup this week.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.
Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the
run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has
been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the
wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you
should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has
only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect
another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season.
He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we
recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you
use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you
consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the
season.

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep
leagues.

Travis Minor, RB MIA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the
defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills
have been weak against the run all season.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While
he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every
week.

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the
end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but
you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running
back depth around the league. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'
secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He
might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and
there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas
City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep
league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your
lineup.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday,
which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We
recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against
the Jets in Week Nine.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should
rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against
this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less
mistake-prone quarterback.

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Alexander will be back in the
starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent
prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a
gamble. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't
recommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this
is the game he will break his slump.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some
trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia
secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore,
and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at
quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat
Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for
explosive stats.

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to
keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less
impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes
than most receivers in the league.

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
There's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing
the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this
week if you have no other options at running back.

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance
Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight
end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However,
you should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday
against San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way
and post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend
you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent.
However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer
downfield for great stats this week.

Dominic Rhodes, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should
definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats,
but should give good rushing totals and a score.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Clark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in
recent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game
Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend
these two tight ends, if you need to start one it should definitely be
Clark.

Dwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Carswell might factor into the Broncos' passing game more Thursday against
Dallas due to a thin corps at wide receiver. However, he had no catches in
similar circumstances in Week 10, and the Cowboys will be ready to defend
short passes to him. Only use Carswell if you're thin at the tight end
position.

Keith Poole, WR DEN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
If Rod Smith indeed misses Thursday's game against Dallas, Poole will need
to step up as the Broncos' top receiving target. However, we don't
recommend you use him in a Fantasy league until he first proves himself a
reliable point-producer. Keep Poole reserved against Dallas.

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Don't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. he has been inconsistent
this season, and may not do much against a physical Pittsburgh defense.

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Mason should post respectable statistics against the Steelers. Don't expect
him to be intimidated by the Pittsburgh defense.

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Alstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't
expect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,
scoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. 

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Johnson threw for 399 yards last week against Chicago, but he also threw no
touchdowns and was picked off twice. He's been unreliable from a Fantasy
standpoint, and is a gamble even when the matchup is in his favor. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Johnson had a big game against Chicago last weekend, catching 12 passes for
89 yards. He was held out of the end zone again, but look for that to
change on Monday night against St. Louis. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New
England. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,
so avoid starting him if at all possible. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Holt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last weekend against
New England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the league, and is
worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Bruce had a huge game against New England last weekend, posting seven
catches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid game in Week 11 against
a Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big play. 

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Gary will likely get a fair number of carries Thursday against Dallas, but
we don't expect him to provide useful Fantasy stats. The Cowboys will
probably focus on the run, which makes both Gary and Mike Anderson risky
starts this week since they have been splitting time.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
With favorite target Rod Smith likely sidelined by injury, Griese will have
questionable receivers to work with Thursday against Dallas. However, the
Cowboys' defense will probably focus on the run and force Griese to beat
them through the air. He should provide your team with decent stats and is
worth using this week.

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Faulk had 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against New England last
weekend. He's the best player in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in
any league format. 

Jamel White, RB CLE - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
The Browns may use White as a change-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar
Bengals run defense. You might want to consider him as a third running back
option on your team if you're lacking in starting options.

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Conwell has had a few down weeks, and is now listed as questionable for
Monday's game against Tampa Bay due to a shoulder injury. With the lack of
depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is
something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do if he's
healthy. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401
yards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and
will throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent
secondary. 

O.J. Santiago, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Santiago catches the occasional pass for the Browns and could find the end
zone every now or then. He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati
secondary, so maybe this is one of the rare weeks he scores. Only use
Santiago if you're desperate for a tight end, however, as he rarely gets a
big yardage total.

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Johnson has been a prime target for Tim Couch in the Cleveland passing game
this season, and is now a very reliable No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver.
Johnson is on a real hot streak and has a good career record against the
Bengals, his opponent for this week, so get him into your lineup.

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Couch has a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards,
four TDs), whom he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks
you could choose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week,
give him a look.

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Warrick has been catching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't
provided stats worthy of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league.
His matchup against Cleveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him
reserved this week.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Although Scott has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last two games
against the Browns, whom he plays Sunday, we can't recommend you use him
this week. He has been far too inconsistent and a real disappointment from
a Fantasy perspective.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
We can't advise you use Kitna as he goes up against the Browns' secondary
this week. Cleveland has been very stingy against the pass all year,
leading the league in interceptions and ranking ninth overall in sacks.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the
Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678
rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in
your active lineup week in and week out in any league.

Larry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Centers has been a great pass-catching back for the Bills this season, but
he will face a Miami defense on Sunday that will likely be able to contain
him. Only use him if you have no other alternative on your bench.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Price has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recent weeks,
logging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a bigger
challenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reserving him.

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
There's a good chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week
against a solid Miami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent
limited role in the Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he
has a good history against the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and
he might be worth using as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.

Eric Johnson, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against Carolina.
Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't really worth
starting at this point. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Stokes had a solid game last weekend, catching eight passes for 72 yards
and two touchdowns against Carolina. He's been very unreliable overall,
however, so starting him is still a risky move. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Henry had a very disappointing game against the Seahawks in Week 10, and
will likely struggle again against the far-better Dolphins defense on
Sunday. He has been far too inconsistent to merit using this week.

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Van Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a
strong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar
Seahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this
week despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the
bench for Week 11.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
After a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self.
We don't expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars, so
don't use him this week.

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Sharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving
touchdown on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced
Jacksonville, and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe
into your active lineup every week.

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Ismail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly
developing into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot
streak and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you
get Ismail into your starting lineup this week.

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Buckhalter will return from suspension this weekend, and will be available
for Sunday's game against Washington. Duce Staley has established himself
as the Eagles' featured back, so starting Buckhalter is a gamble. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Staley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in
Philadelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes
him worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Just when you think Thrash is reliable, he puts up two catches for 17 yards
like he did last weekend against Dallas. Thrash will still be in the
starting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams, but he's a gamble nonetheless. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.
He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for
Fantasy owners overall. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Barber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a
touchdown in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run
this season, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their
offense in Week 11. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a
sore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,
however, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Toomer caught five balls for 60 yards against Minnesota on Monday night,
but he'll struggle to post similar numbers vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a
formidable secondary, so benching Toomer in smaller Fantasy leagues is a
wise move. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Collins had a solid game yardage-wise against Minnesota, throwing for 321
yards on Monday night. However, he has had trouble getting the ball into
the end zone consistently, which makes him a risky Fantasy player. As a
result, benching him in Week 11 against Oakland is advisable. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Jackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a Fantasy player, but he does
have the potential to post great numbers every week. If you play in a
deeper league, it's worth taking a gamble on Jackson against New England. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Horn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries, but he's been playing
through them quite well. In fact, Horn has 14 catches for 247 yards and two
touchdowns in his last two games, and is a must-start in Week 11 against
New England based on his potential to post huge numbers. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Bennett is proving all the critics right who said he wasn't ready for the
NFL style of game. He's been a huge Fantasy disappointment and is barely
worth a roster spot at this point. He'll do nothing against Chicago's
aggressive run defense, so don't bother starting him. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Culpepper finally had a breakout game last week, connecting on four
touchdown passes against the N.Y. Giants. He should have success against
Chicago's secondary on Sunday, so be sure to include him when you choose
your Week 11 starting lineup. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Carter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against
the Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should
have another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is
ranked last in the league. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
The Colts placed Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday with a damaged ligament
in his right foot, effectively ending his season. He will undergo surgery
in the near future, and you should cut him if you were holding onto him
awaiting his return.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Glenn did not practice Tuesday or participate in the pre-practice
walkthrough on Wednesday, according to published reports. He is unlikely to
play Sunday against New Orleans and shouldn't be on anyone's Fantasy roster
at this point.

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Chamberlain locked up his right knee on Monday night against the N.Y.
Giants, but he's expected to play this weekend vs. Chicago. Chamberlain has
been unreliable of late, and getting open against Chicago's tough
linebacking group won't be an easy task. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Green had a huge game against Detroit back in Week One, rushing for 157
yards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 against those same
Lions, whose defense is questionable at best. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Favre had a somewhat rough outing last weekend, throwing three
interceptions against Atlanta. However, he's still one of the best Fantasy
quarterbacks in the league, and he should bounce back on Thanksgiving
against Detroit. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Freeman has been solid of late, catching four touchdown passes in his last
five games. He's a must start against Detroit's vulnerable pass defense in
Week 11. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Franks has cooled off considerably in recent weeks, but his potential to
find the end zone still makes him a good Fantasy player. Unless you have a
better option, starting Franks is advisable. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 55 yards and a touchdown last weekend
against Atlanta. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy receivers in
the league, and should have a huge game vs. Detroit's weak secondary. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Batch had a huge game against Arizona last weekend, but he's been
inconsistent this season for the most part. He's better off used when the
matchup is right, so facing a tough Green Bay defense may not bode well for
his Fantasy numbers.

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Morton had a big game against Arizona last weekend, and has been a
surprisingly reliable Fantasy player this season. He may struggle against
Green Bay's tough pass defense, but he's still worth taking a gamble on in
Week 11. 

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Howard is not expected to miss an extended period of time due to his
shoulder injury. He hasn't practitced this week, however, and is listed as
doubtful for Thursday's game against Green Bay. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Emanuel, who suffered a sprained left knee during last weekend's game
against Arizona, will miss at least four weeks of action. There was a
chance that he'd be out for the season, but now he's expected to return in
mid-to-late December. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Stewart (ankle) practiced on Tuesday and feels as though he's ready to
return to action. ""I feel pretty good,"" Stewart told the <I>Detroit Free
Press</I>. ""It felt better than I thought. I'm just going to see, let (the
medical staff and coach Marty Mornhinweg) decide whether I play or not.""
His carries may be down a bit in his first game back, but he's worth
starting in deeper leagues, barring any setbacks. 

Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Hambrick will return to fullback/backup duties on Thursday against Denver.
With Emmitt Smith expected to play, Hambrick isn't worth starting on your
Fantasy team in Week 11. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Galloway is a shell of his former self, catching only 24 passes through his
first seven games this season. Dallas' pathetic quarterbacks have been the
real reason for Galloway's subpar numbers, making him a huge gamble from a
Fantasy perspective. Unless you're desperate, don't consider starting
Galloway in Week 11. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Ismail has been Dallas' most consistent receiver, but starting him is still
a gamble from a Fantasy perspective. Dallas has the worst pass offense in
the league, so playing Ismail isn't advisable unless you're desperate. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Miller put up solid numbers last weekend against Tampa Bay, throwing for
228 yards and three touchdowns. Miller has been inconsistent this season,
but starting him in Week 11 against a shaky Minnesota secondary is
definitely worth considering.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Thomas' yardage numbers have slipped in the last two weeks, but he's still
worth starting in Week 11 vs. Minnesota. The Vikings are giving up 124.3
yards rushing per game, so look for the Bears to run Thomas early and
often. 

Dez White, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
White is dealing with a slight ankle injury, but he's expected to play
against Minnesota. The Vikings secondary has been vulnerable to the pass
this season, so starting White in a deeper league is worth considering. 

Isaac Byrd, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Byrd will likely start in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad in Week 11
against Atlanta. The Falcons pass defense is one of the worst units in the
league, so Byrd could actually put up some decent Fantasy numbers. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Walls put up only two catches for 30 yards last weekend, but he did find
the end zone for the fifth time this season. Unless you've got a better
option, starting Walls on a weekly basis is advisable. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Smith had a mediocre game last weekend vs. Green Bay, but he's likely to
bounce back against Carolina. The Panthers have the worst run defense in
the league, so Smith should have no problem putting up solid Fantasy
numbers in Week 11. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at all this season, but he
could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Panthers secondary is one
of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues
may be worth considering. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on
Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary hasn't been playing well
of late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is
advisable.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Luccis Losers Player News

Alex Van Pelt, Reserve QB Updated 11/21/01
Van Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a
strong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar
Seahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this
week despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the
bench for Week 11.

Charlie Garner, Active RB Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.
Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the
run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

Mike Alstott, Reserve RB Updated 11/21/01
Alstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't
expect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,
scoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01
Hakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New
England. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,
so avoid starting him if at all possible. 

Cris Carter, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Carter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against
the Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should
have another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is
ranked last in the league. 

Kurt Warner, Active QB Updated 11/21/01
Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401
yards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and
will throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent
secondary. 

James McKnight, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep
leagues.

Larry Parker, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'
secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He
might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Duce Staley, Active RB Updated 11/21/01
Staley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in
Philadelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes
him worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. 

Ike Hilliard, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Hilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a
sore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,
however, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. 

Cameron Cleeland, Reserve TE Updated 11/20/01
Cleeland (ankle) is doubtful for Sunday's game at New England. He'll likely
be replaced again by Boo Williams, who scored two touchdowns last week
against Indianapolis. 

Donald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 11/20/01
Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He
may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this
weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the
league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11. 

Ravens, Active DT Updated 11/20/01
Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after
undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of
the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage
than usual. 

Marty Booker, Active WR Updated 11/18/01
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his
third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player
you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. 

David Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a
field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this
season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their
bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

Latest NFL Player News

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Graham has been quiet recently, but may bust out of a mini-slump against
the Cardinals. His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch
a TD pass.

Jerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
The loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis'
output over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him
every week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent
Titans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats
and may even find the end zone.

Curtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been
very soft all year long.

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is
still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a
weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use
him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.

Darrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use
their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander,
and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.

Tim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield
in their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your
active lineup this week.

Charlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.
Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the
run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

David Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has
been inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the
wideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you
should consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.

Troy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has
only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect
another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season.
He'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we
recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you
use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you
consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the
season.

James McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep
leagues.

Travis Minor, RB MIA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the
defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills
have been weak against the run all season.

Tony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While
he has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every
week.

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Davis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the
end zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but
you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running
back depth around the league. 

Larry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'
secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He
might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Tony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Richardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and
there's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas
City should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep
league or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your
lineup.

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday,
which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We
recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against
the Jets in Week Nine.

Trent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should
rebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against
this questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less
mistake-prone quarterback.

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
According to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Alexander will be back in the
starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent
prior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a
gamble. 

Kyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Brady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't
recommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this
is the game he will break his slump.

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some
trouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia
secondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore,
and that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at
quarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat
Starks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for
explosive stats.

Jimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to
keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less
impressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes
than most receivers in the league.

Elvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
There's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing
the Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this
week if you have no other options at running back.

Marcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance
Schulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight
end in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However,
you should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.

Terrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday
against San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way
and post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend
you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.

Marvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Harrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent.
However, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer
downfield for great stats this week.

Dominic Rhodes, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should
definitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats,
but should give good rushing totals and a score.

Desmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Clark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in
recent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game
Thursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend
these two tight ends, if you need to start one it should definitely be
Clark.

Dwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Carswell might factor into the Broncos' passing game more Thursday against
Dallas due to a thin corps at wide receiver. However, he had no catches in
similar circumstances in Week 10, and the Cowboys will be ready to defend
short passes to him. Only use Carswell if you're thin at the tight end
position.

Keith Poole, WR DEN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
If Rod Smith indeed misses Thursday's game against Dallas, Poole will need
to step up as the Broncos' top receiving target. However, we don't
recommend you use him in a Fantasy league until he first proves himself a
reliable point-producer. Keep Poole reserved against Dallas.

Kevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Don't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. he has been inconsistent
this season, and may not do much against a physical Pittsburgh defense.

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Mason should post respectable statistics against the Steelers. Don't expect
him to be intimidated by the Pittsburgh defense.

Mike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Alstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't
expect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,
scoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. 

Brad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Johnson threw for 399 yards last week against Chicago, but he also threw no
touchdowns and was picked off twice. He's been unreliable from a Fantasy
standpoint, and is a gamble even when the matchup is in his favor. 

Keyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Johnson had a big game against Chicago last weekend, catching 12 passes for
89 yards. He was held out of the end zone again, but look for that to
change on Monday night against St. Louis. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New
England. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,
so avoid starting him if at all possible. 

Torry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Holt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last weekend against
New England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the league, and is
worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Bruce had a huge game against New England last weekend, posting seven
catches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid game in Week 11 against
a Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big play. 

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Gary will likely get a fair number of carries Thursday against Dallas, but
we don't expect him to provide useful Fantasy stats. The Cowboys will
probably focus on the run, which makes both Gary and Mike Anderson risky
starts this week since they have been splitting time.

Brian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
With favorite target Rod Smith likely sidelined by injury, Griese will have
questionable receivers to work with Thursday against Dallas. However, the
Cowboys' defense will probably focus on the run and force Griese to beat
them through the air. He should provide your team with decent stats and is
worth using this week.

Marshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Faulk had 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against New England last
weekend. He's the best player in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in
any league format. 

Jamel White, RB CLE - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
The Browns may use White as a change-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar
Bengals run defense. You might want to consider him as a third running back
option on your team if you're lacking in starting options.

Ernie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Conwell has had a few down weeks, and is now listed as questionable for
Monday's game against Tampa Bay due to a shoulder injury. With the lack of
depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is
something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do if he's
healthy. 

Kurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401
yards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and
will throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent
secondary. 

O.J. Santiago, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Santiago catches the occasional pass for the Browns and could find the end
zone every now or then. He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati
secondary, so maybe this is one of the rare weeks he scores. Only use
Santiago if you're desperate for a tight end, however, as he rarely gets a
big yardage total.

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Johnson has been a prime target for Tim Couch in the Cleveland passing game
this season, and is now a very reliable No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver.
Johnson is on a real hot streak and has a good career record against the
Bengals, his opponent for this week, so get him into your lineup.

Tim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Couch has a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards,
four TDs), whom he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks
you could choose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week,
give him a look.

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Warrick has been catching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't
provided stats worthy of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league.
His matchup against Cleveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him
reserved this week.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Although Scott has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last two games
against the Browns, whom he plays Sunday, we can't recommend you use him
this week. He has been far too inconsistent and a real disappointment from
a Fantasy perspective.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
We can't advise you use Kitna as he goes up against the Browns' secondary
this week. Cleveland has been very stingy against the pass all year,
leading the league in interceptions and ranking ninth overall in sacks.

Corey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the
Browns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678
rushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in
your active lineup week in and week out in any league.

Larry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Centers has been a great pass-catching back for the Bills this season, but
he will face a Miami defense on Sunday that will likely be able to contain
him. Only use him if you have no other alternative on your bench.

Peerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Price has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recent weeks,
logging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a bigger
challenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reserving him.

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
There's a good chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week
against a solid Miami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent
limited role in the Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he
has a good history against the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and
he might be worth using as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.

Eric Johnson, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Johnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against Carolina.
Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't really worth
starting at this point. 

J.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Stokes had a solid game last weekend, catching eight passes for 72 yards
and two touchdowns against Carolina. He's been very unreliable overall,
however, so starting him is still a risky move. 

Travis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Henry had a very disappointing game against the Seahawks in Week 10, and
will likely struggle again against the far-better Dolphins defense on
Sunday. He has been far too inconsistent to merit using this week.

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Van Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a
strong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar
Seahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this
week despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the
bench for Week 11.

Travis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
After a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self.
We don't expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars, so
don't use him this week.

Shannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Sharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving
touchdown on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced
Jacksonville, and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe
into your active lineup every week.

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Ismail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly
developing into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot
streak and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you
get Ismail into your starting lineup this week.

Correll Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01
Buckhalter will return from suspension this weekend, and will be available
for Sunday's game against Washington. Duce Staley has established himself
as the Eagles' featured back, so starting Buckhalter is a gamble. 

Duce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Staley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in
Philadelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes
him worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. 

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Just when you think Thrash is reliable, he puts up two catches for 17 yards
like he did last weekend against Dallas. Thrash will still be in the
starting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams, but he's a gamble nonetheless. 

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.
He may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for
Fantasy owners overall. 

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Barber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a
touchdown in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run
this season, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their
offense in Week 11. 

Ike Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Hilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a
sore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,
however, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. 

Amani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Toomer caught five balls for 60 yards against Minnesota on Monday night,
but he'll struggle to post similar numbers vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a
formidable secondary, so benching Toomer in smaller Fantasy leagues is a
wise move. 

Kerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Collins had a solid game yardage-wise against Minnesota, throwing for 321
yards on Monday night. However, he has had trouble getting the ball into
the end zone consistently, which makes him a risky Fantasy player. As a
result, benching him in Week 11 against Oakland is advisable. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01
Jackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a Fantasy player, but he does
have the potential to post great numbers every week. If you play in a
deeper league, it's worth taking a gamble on Jackson against New England. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Horn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries, but he's been playing
through them quite well. In fact, Horn has 14 catches for 247 yards and two
touchdowns in his last two games, and is a must-start in Week 11 against
New England based on his potential to post huge numbers. 

Michael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Bennett is proving all the critics right who said he wasn't ready for the
NFL style of game. He's been a huge Fantasy disappointment and is barely
worth a roster spot at this point. He'll do nothing against Chicago's
aggressive run defense, so don't bother starting him. 

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Culpepper finally had a breakout game last week, connecting on four
touchdown passes against the N.Y. Giants. He should have success against
Chicago's secondary on Sunday, so be sure to include him when you choose
your Week 11 starting lineup. 

Cris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01
Carter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against
the Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should
have another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is
ranked last in the league. 

Jerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
The Colts placed Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday with a damaged ligament
in his right foot, effectively ending his season. He will undergo surgery
in the near future, and you should cut him if you were holding onto him
awaiting his return.

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Glenn did not practice Tuesday or participate in the pre-practice
walkthrough on Wednesday, according to published reports. He is unlikely to
play Sunday against New Orleans and shouldn't be on anyone's Fantasy roster
at this point.

Byron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01
Chamberlain locked up his right knee on Monday night against the N.Y.
Giants, but he's expected to play this weekend vs. Chicago. Chamberlain has
been unreliable of late, and getting open against Chicago's tough
linebacking group won't be an easy task. 

Ahman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Green had a huge game against Detroit back in Week One, rushing for 157
yards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 against those same
Lions, whose defense is questionable at best. 

Brett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Favre had a somewhat rough outing last weekend, throwing three
interceptions against Atlanta. However, he's still one of the best Fantasy
quarterbacks in the league, and he should bounce back on Thanksgiving
against Detroit. 

Antonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01
Freeman has been solid of late, catching four touchdown passes in his last
five games. He's a must start against Detroit's vulnerable pass defense in
Week 11. 

Bubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Franks has cooled off considerably in recent weeks, but his potential to
find the end zone still makes him a good Fantasy player. Unless you have a
better option, starting Franks is advisable. 

Bill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Schroeder caught four passes for 55 yards and a touchdown last weekend
against Atlanta. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy receivers in
the league, and should have a huge game vs. Detroit's weak secondary. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01
Batch had a huge game against Arizona last weekend, but he's been
inconsistent this season for the most part. He's better off used when the
matchup is right, so facing a tough Green Bay defense may not bode well for
his Fantasy numbers.

Johnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Morton had a big game against Arizona last weekend, and has been a
surprisingly reliable Fantasy player this season. He may struggle against
Green Bay's tough pass defense, but he's still worth taking a gamble on in
Week 11. 

Desmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Howard is not expected to miss an extended period of time due to his
shoulder injury. He hasn't practitced this week, however, and is listed as
doubtful for Thursday's game against Green Bay. 

Bert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01
Emanuel, who suffered a sprained left knee during last weekend's game
against Arizona, will miss at least four weeks of action. There was a
chance that he'd be out for the season, but now he's expected to return in
mid-to-late December. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01
Stewart (ankle) practiced on Tuesday and feels as though he's ready to
return to action. ""I feel pretty good,"" Stewart told the <I>Detroit Free
Press</I>. ""It felt better than I thought. I'm just going to see, let (the
medical staff and coach Marty Mornhinweg) decide whether I play or not.""
His carries may be down a bit in his first game back, but he's worth
starting in deeper leagues, barring any setbacks. 

Troy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Hambrick will return to fullback/backup duties on Thursday against Denver.
With Emmitt Smith expected to play, Hambrick isn't worth starting on your
Fantasy team in Week 11. 

Joey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Galloway is a shell of his former self, catching only 24 passes through his
first seven games this season. Dallas' pathetic quarterbacks have been the
real reason for Galloway's subpar numbers, making him a huge gamble from a
Fantasy perspective. Unless you're desperate, don't consider starting
Galloway in Week 11. 

Raghib Ismail, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01
Ismail has been Dallas' most consistent receiver, but starting him is still
a gamble from a Fantasy perspective. Dallas has the worst pass offense in
the league, so playing Ismail isn't advisable unless you're desperate. 

Jim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01
Miller put up solid numbers last weekend against Tampa Bay, throwing for
228 yards and three touchdowns. Miller has been inconsistent this season,
but starting him in Week 11 against a shaky Minnesota secondary is
definitely worth considering.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
Thomas' yardage numbers have slipped in the last two weeks, but he's still
worth starting in Week 11 vs. Minnesota. The Vikings are giving up 124.3
yards rushing per game, so look for the Bears to run Thomas early and
often. 

Dez White, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01
White is dealing with a slight ankle injury, but he's expected to play
against Minnesota. The Vikings secondary has been vulnerable to the pass
this season, so starting White in a deeper league is worth considering. 

Isaac Byrd, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01
Byrd will likely start in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad in Week 11
against Atlanta. The Falcons pass defense is one of the worst units in the
league, so Byrd could actually put up some decent Fantasy numbers. 

Wesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01
Walls put up only two catches for 30 yards last weekend, but he did find
the end zone for the fifth time this season. Unless you've got a better
option, starting Walls on a weekly basis is advisable. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Smith had a mediocre game last weekend vs. Green Bay, but he's likely to
bounce back against Carolina. The Panthers have the worst run defense in
the league, so Smith should have no problem putting up solid Fantasy
numbers in Week 11. 

Tony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01
Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at all this season, but he
could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Panthers secondary is one
of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues
may be worth considering. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01
Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on
Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary hasn't been playing well
of late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is
advisable.

Luccis Losers Player News

Alex Van Pelt, Reserve QB Updated 11/21/01
Van Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a
strong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar
Seahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this
week despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the
bench for Week 11.

Charlie Garner, Active RB Updated 11/21/01
Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.
Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the
run. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.

Mike Alstott, Reserve RB Updated 11/21/01
Alstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't
expect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,
scoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. 

Az-Zahir Hakim, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01
Hakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New
England. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,
so avoid starting him if at all possible. 

Cris Carter, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Carter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against
the Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should
have another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is
ranked last in the league. 

Kurt Warner, Active QB Updated 11/21/01
Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401
yards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and
will throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent
secondary. 

James McKnight, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01
There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep
leagues.

Larry Parker, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01
Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'
secondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He
might make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.

Duce Staley, Active RB Updated 11/21/01
Staley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in
Philadelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes
him worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. 

Ike Hilliard, Active WR Updated 11/21/01
Hilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a
sore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,
however, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. 

Cameron Cleeland, Reserve TE Updated 11/20/01
Cleeland (ankle) is doubtful for Sunday's game at New England. He'll likely
be replaced again by Boo Williams, who scored two touchdowns last week
against Indianapolis. 

Donald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 11/20/01
Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He
may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this
weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the
league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11. 

Ravens, Active DT Updated 11/20/01
Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after
undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of
the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage
than usual. 

Marty Booker, Active WR Updated 11/18/01
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his
third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player
you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. 

David Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00
Akers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a
field goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this
season, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their
bye week during some league's Fantasy championship game.

Texas Set Meeting Jan 22nd and 23rd<<<

<<<BODY START>>>
It is hard to get travel and hotel reservations with a one day notice.

Want to attend and participate but am not sure I can get there.

There are a lot of issues on the agenda.  Many of these probably have some
material which could be provided up front so we can be prepared to
review/discuss.

Would it be possible to reschedule this for next week?

ACCOMPLISHMENTS:

Since joining the Enron Real Time Group in January, I feel that I have become a valuable, knowledgeable member of the Team.  I consistently show a willingness to learn and take on new responsibilities, whether it be training new members of the group or developing new ideas.  

I have learned all the major responsibilities in a short period of time which include cut management, balancing reports, and taking responsible and favorable risk to reward opportunities.

I participate in all extracurricular activities such as onsite training to further my knowledge of the power trading business.

I have demonstrated the ability to keep a two-way market on both the bloomberg and the APX Trading Platforms.

I have learned all the major and some minor transmission points and have demonstrated my ability to wheel power around the WSCC grid.

I feel my leadership abilities have helped the newer members of the group learn their duties by following my example in every day tasks.

I have built a good rapport with most of the cash and term trading members, and support staff.  This includes taking time to understand how my job affects others.

I know all the functions of Enpower.

I know to schedule transmission on all the Oasis websites.

I know how to tag on a real time basis and am ready for the implementation of no-tag, no-flow.

I know how to schedule power on CAPS and CISO WORKSPACE.

GOALS:

Become more effective at trading power and eventually earn a trading position with Cash or Term.

Have a zero tolerance for errors in my daily work which includes note taking, empower, and cut management.

Become manager of Real Time Group in 6 mos. to 1 year.

rices

FYI.  This is the presentation that the Brattle Group---a consulting group=
=20
that Edison has long used on gas issues in California---gave last week to t=
he=20
legislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the California=
=20
Border.  The day following this presentation (which was followed by a=20
presentation by the California PUC's FERC lawyer), the committee called El=
=20
Paso and Dynegy to respond to Brattle's and the CPUC FERC lawyer's=20
presentations.  Also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that I've=
=20
seen in the press.

Best,
Jeff
***************************************************************************=
***
****************************************************
Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation

Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20
California Assembly
has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the=
=20
state=01,s current
energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane=
d=20
heavily on a
report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility=
=20
Southern California
Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.

But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu=
ral=20
Gas -- is not
ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i=
t=20
recently presented
as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.

As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=
UC=20
are pointing
the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=
r=20
prices through
affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =
El=20
Paso is The Brattle
Group=01,s study of the California market.

Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=
=20
of the
California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20
Group=01,s market
study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=
=20
caused by normal
market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=
=20
which Assembly
members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=
=20
the California
market.

El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=
t=20
presented to
legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=
=20
of factors, not a
conspiracy, caused the price run-up.

Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=
so=20
to conduct
work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20
concluded that the
increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=
=20
main culprits in the
California gas price imbroglio.

Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=
=20
said he
""didn=01,t see any smoking gun"" in either report.

""We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20
Study and a little
on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20
legislature is the best
place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,"" Campbell=20
said. ""I believe FERC
is looking at this situation "" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=
=20
appropriate place.""

Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=
=20
give support
to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. ""It=01,s being pushed=20
basically by the Public
Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion"" by=20
pipeline companies to
push up gas prices in California, he said.

The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20
assembly when
it had failed on the federal level: ""There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=
t on=20
natural gas but on other
things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=
=20
finger elsewhere for
the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=
g some=20
of that with the
public utilities commission.""

Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20
prices is a different
matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=
em=20
to have taken
on a life of their own.

The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=
=20
litigated effort to
force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20
participants. Following
on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=
=20
The Brattle Group
report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20
major pipelines that
serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.

Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=
=20
requested data
contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20
process to move
forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=
=20
access to evidence
(GD 4/23).

Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=
=20
case. The commission
recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=
=20
large block of
pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20
addressing the California
Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=
e=20
California border
controversy obviated the need for more investigation.

The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=
=20
hearing into
whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=
e=20
up the price of gas
delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=
=20
this summer. (RP00-

that Edison has long used on gas issues in California---gave last week to t=

legislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the California=

Border.  The day following this presentation (which was followed by a=20
presentation by the California PUC's FERC lawyer), the committee called El=

presentations.  Also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that I've=

Competing evidence clouds Calif. investigation

Prompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20
California Assembly
has been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the=
=20
state=01,s current
energy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane=
d=20
heavily on a
report prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility=
=20
Southern California
Edison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.

But the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu=
ral=20
Gas -- is not
ready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i=
t=20
recently presented
as evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.

As reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=
UC=20
are pointing
the finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=
r=20
prices through
affiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =
El=20
Paso is The Brattle
Group=01,s study of the California market.

Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=
=20
of the
California Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20
Group=01,s market
study proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=
=20
caused by normal
market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=
=20
which Assembly
members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=
=20
the California
market.

El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=
t=20
presented to
legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=
=20
of factors, not a
conspiracy, caused the price run-up.

Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=
so=20
to conduct
work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20
concluded that the
increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=
=20
main culprits in the
California gas price imbroglio.

Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=
=20
said he
""didn=01,t see any smoking gun"" in either report.

""We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20
Study and a little
on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20
legislature is the best
place to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,"" Campbell=20
said. ""I believe FERC
is looking at this situation "" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=
=20
appropriate place.""

Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=
=20
give support
to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. ""It=01,s being pushed=20
basically by the Public
Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion"" by=20
pipeline companies to
push up gas prices in California, he said.

The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20
assembly when
it had failed on the federal level: ""There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=
t on=20
natural gas but on other
things here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=
=20
finger elsewhere for
the problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=
g some=20
of that with the
public utilities commission.""

Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20
prices is a different
matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=
em=20
to have taken
on a life of their own.

The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=
=20
litigated effort to
force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20
participants. Following
on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=
=20
The Brattle Group
report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20
major pipelines that
serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.

Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=
=20
requested data
contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20
process to move
forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=
=20
access to evidence
(GD 4/23).

Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=
=20
case. The commission
recently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=
=20
large block of
pipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20
addressing the California
Assembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=
e=20
California border
controversy obviated the need for more investigation.

The controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=
=20
hearing into
whether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=
e=20
up the price of gas
delivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=
=20
this summer. (RP00-

FYI....Risk Mangaement/ potential base rate changes behind Ohio Gas

SUBJECT END>>>

<<<BODY START>>>
Introduction
Yesterday afternoon I met with executives from Columbia of Ohio, the Ohio 
Manufacturers Association and Honda of America Manufacturing and discussed a 
property tax bill that COH, EOG, Ohio's Counties and the schools wish to 
introduce tomorrow through the Senate Ways and Means Committee.  They are 
expecting their sponsors to be Senators Blessing and Motley.  They may also 
concurrently introduce the bill through the House Public Utilities Committee 
through Chair Lynn Olman or David Goodman.  Columbia expects the first 
hearing to be May 2nd.  

When asked why the hurry...COH is in litigation concerning disparate 
treatment as it relates to taxes (they are currently in the Ohio appellate 
and believes if this bill goes forward they will be able to reach settlement 
with regards to the litigation before the court of appeals).  The Judge is 
expected to come out with a ruling in May.  However,  if this legislation 
looks promising Columbia may very well reach settlement with the 
counterparties on the litigation prior to the courts ruling.  (I believe the 
counterparty is the Ohio schools)

I asked who they have discussed the bill with at this point and where they 
felt each party stood.  Columbia said they have talked with Senator Finan 
(President of the Senate) (no problem of course), Rob Tongren, Ohio's 
Consumers Counsel (but they haven't met with the OCC staff to go over the 
detailed analysis of impacts based on revenue class), they have sent a copy 
over to the PUCO, Cinergy (who didn't think they had a problem) took it back 
for review, the IEU (Industrial Endusers of Ohio)  said they weren't overly 
pleased but didn't say they would get in the way, the counties and the 
schools.  They have not discussed this with DP&L.  COH and EOG do not play 
well in the sandbox with DP&L and didn't feel they needed to give them a 
heads up.  COH also met with the Department of Taxation.  Although the Tax 
Department did not have any particular concerns as of yet they were concerned 
about what the electric utilities would want to do in light of what the gas 
utilities would have as a result.

The Bill
The bill only addresses property tax which is based on rate base revenues.  
It does not address gross receipts tax.  At first glance and after my 
follow-up discussions with Columbia I would say that the bill does not have 
any disparate treatment between transporting customers and those on system 
supply. Any tax or corresponding base rate reduction would be treated the 
same for sales and transport.  With that said , there is a base rate impact 
on different classes of customers and each utility will be effected 
differently due to the fact that they customers contribution to base rates 
revenues and allocation methodologies.  Below please find the impacts as 
suggested by Columbia:


Rate Class	Columbia of Ohio (total yearly $ impact)	East Ohio Gas
		new rate per mcf 	Cinergy
			Do not have Cinergy numbers as the computations were not provided
Residential	 decrease ($.67) per year	increase $.1532/mcf	increase
Commercial/GTS	increase $9.59 per year	increase $.0892/mcf for usage of up to 2000 
mcf per year	COH wasn't sure but felt it would most likely be an increase
Industrial/LGTS	increase $2,937.91 per year	decrease (industrials that use over 
2000 mcf over what they are currently contributing
		but a rate of $.0650	decrease 
Large Industrials with whom Columbia has flexed its distribution rates to 
$.25/LGTS	increase: none
	Columbia will flex their rates down to $.13 to compensate for the tax 
increase so the impact is zero	$.02/mcf for flexed rate customers	decrease

Columbia of Ohio and East Ohio Gas represent roughly 80 % of the states gas 
volumes.  Rough estimate:  with the reduction in the property tax rate from 
88% to 25% this represents approximately $34 million dollars to Columbia 
based on their 1994 case in which their base rates were set and their tax 
obligation was roughly $53 million approx.)Section VIII of the bill discussed 
the corresponding reductions in base rates that will be made and discussed 
the allocation.  
If and when the legislation goes through,  COH and EOG would file schedules 
with the PUCO.  If the bill is passed as written the rate reductions would be 
effective 1/1/01 and the tax would become effective 7/1/01.

For risk management and deal structuring purposes we will want to watch the 
bill carefully, as any changes made to allocation methodologies could have an 
impact on our business going forward.   In addition,  the bill originally has 
language that address the gross receipts tax on commodity in Ohio and we will 
want to make sure the utilities do not change their mind and insert gross 
reciepts language back in.

I will be sending the supporting documents to Howard Petricoff, Dayem 
Khandker, Dennis Benevides, and Paul Tate.  If you do not receive a copy of 
the bill or the computation sheets and would like a copy, please give me a 
call and I will send them.

The rest of us should tell California to go fly a kite 

By DAVE BARRY  

When we consider the serious electricity shortage in California, our  
reaction, as concerned Americans, is: Ha ha!  

No, seriously, we are alarmed. Because history teaches us that whatever  
happens to California -- smog, road rage, tofu, coffee that is mainly air, 
cell  phones, the belief that abdominal muscles are attractive, Shirley 
MacLaine,  people taking in-line skating seriously, grandmothers sporting new 
and  flagrantly inappropriate bosoms -- eventually happens to the rest of the 
nation.  Thus it is vital that we analyze the California electricity shortage 
and see if  we can develop a workable solution before we become bored and 
change the  subject.  

Our first question is: What, exactly, is electricity? When we look in our  
Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia, we see that ""electricity"" is defined  as a 
""class of physical phenomena resulting from the existence of charge  and from 
the interaction of charges."" What does this mean, in lay-person's  terms?  

It means that whoever wrote the Microsoft Encarta encyclopedia is a big, fat  
dope. Because we know from our junior-high-school science training that  
electricity is actually a fast-moving herd of electrons, which are tiny  
one-celled animals that can survive in almost any environment except inside 
a  double-A battery, where they die within minutes.  

Electrons are formed when clouds rub together and become excited. This was  
proved in the famous experiment wherein Benjamin Franklin flew a kite during 
a  thunderstorm and was almost killed. Encouraged by this success, Franklin 
went on  to conduct many more electrical experiments, including rolling a 
hoop in a  thunderstorm, playing hopscotch in a thunderstorm and doing 
somersaults in a  thunderstorm.  

Finally one night he was caught wearing only a bonnet and playing Mister  
Pooter Rides the Pony in a thunderstorm, leaving the authorities with no 
choice  but to arrest him and make him ambassador to France.  Nevertheless, 
Franklin had proved an important scientific point, which is  that electricity 
originates inside clouds. There it forms into lightning, which  is attracted 
to the earth by golfers.  

After entering the ground, the electricity hardens into coal, which, when 
dug  up by power companies and burned in big ovens called ""generators,""  
turns back into electricity, which is sent in the form of ""volts""  (also 
known as ""watts,"" or ""rpm"" for short) through special  wires with birds 
sitting on them to consumers' homes, where it is transformed by  TV sets into 
commercials for beer, which passes through the consumers and back  into the 
ground, thus completing what is known as a ""circuit.""  

But enough technical talk. The problem is that California is running out of  
electricity. The situation is so bad that in some hospitals, they don't have  
enough electricity to power those electric-shock paddles that get people's  
hearts started again; instead, the doctors and nurses have to hold hands, 
scuff  their feet across the carpet in unison, then shout ""CLEAR!"" as they  
touch the patient's chest.  

Who is responsible for California's electricity shortage? You could blame 
the  power companies; or you could blame environmental wackos; or you could 
blame the  entertainment industry, which uses more than 750 billion watts of 
electricity  per day just to blow-dry the hair of the cast of Dawson's Creek; 
or you  could blame (why not?) the Firestone tire company. But you would be 
wrong.  Because obviously the real cause of the California electricity 
shortage is:  college students.  

I base this statement on widespread observation of my son, who is a college  
student, and who personally consumes more electricity than Belgium. If my son 
is  in a room, then every electrical device within 200 yards of that room -- 
every  light, computer, television, stereo, video game, microwave oven, etc. 
-- will be  running. My son doesn't even have to turn the devices on; they 
activate  themselves spontaneously in response to his presence.  

Now take my son and multiply him by the number of college students in  
California, which according to my research is (EDITOR: Please insert number 
of  college students in California) and you see my point, which is (EDITOR: 
Please  insert my point).  

The question is: What can the rest of us do to help our fellow 
countrypersons  in California? The answer is that we can send them our spare 
electricity. Just  imagine what would happen if all the households in this 
great and generous  nation got out their extension cords and connected them 
together, forming a  giant electrical ""chain of helping"" across the fruited 
plain to the  Golden State! Millions of people would be turned into generous 
smoking lumps of  carbon, that's what. So maybe we should go with Plan B. 
This involves building a  really, really, really big kite.

Player Updates NFL Reports 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the ! st! retch.

Trent Dilfer <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasse! lb! eck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.

Lamar Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=get! ba! d&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=235122&>, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.

Jerome Pathon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12612&>, WR IND - Team Dick ! Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they wil! l ! activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards o! n ! 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1389&>, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. 

Erron Kinney <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12342&>, WR TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
! Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football215.fantasy.sportsli! ne! .com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1306&> , WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football215! .f! antasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1035&>, QB BAL - H! ou! ston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12411&>, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&! ke! y=187503&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1292&>, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was! a! ble to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1109&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

Player Updates NFL Reports

Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 10/23/01
According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the ! st! retch.

Trent Dilfer <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasse! lb! eck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.

Lamar Smith <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=get! ba! d&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=235122&>, WR KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.

Jerome Pathon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12612&>, WR IND - Team Dick ! Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they wil! l ! activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1171&>, RB TB - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards o! n ! 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1389&>, K TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. 

Erron Kinney <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12342&>, WR TEN - President Taft Updated 10/23/01
! Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Team Dick Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football215.fantasy.sportsli! ne! .com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1306&> , WR TEN - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Dont Mess Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football215! .f! antasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1035&>, QB BAL - H! ou! ston Big Ballers Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=12411&>, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&! ke! y=187503&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1292&>, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was! a! ble to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football215.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3589&key=1109&>, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have 
these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.  I think all you need 
to do is send CNG a letter  requesting;

   ""Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011"".

If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they 
send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

thanks

I saw your reply to my previous note.  On this one point:

It strikes me as disingenuous to say that they don't have the internal

work for nonfinancial parties as well as financial parties.  IBJ is the most

financial institutions to provide collateral to non-financial institutions, 
so it may be very difficult for them to alter their position. 

I understand.  My view is just that it is probably not a systems issue but a 
position and it irks me to have the point made as a systems issue when it is 
not.  As we both agree, the  issue may be moot depending on what Credit

I guess it looks OK to me.  I'm surprised that they will have the ability to 
identify their own company as a counterparty.  Don't we limit the companies 
they can designate to those already signed up to trade on EnronOnline?

Mark,

There is a new message to add to the set you previously reviewed, covering 
the case where a broker tries to transact when identifying their own company 
as the counterparty:

Failure Reason: Cannot Complete Transaction to Broker Company
Text Body: The requested Transaction has not completed as the Counterparty 
identified for the transaction attempt is your own company.  For further 
information or to request a change in status, please contact us.

I have passed this text along for incorporation (we have very tight timelines 
as we are hoping to go live tomorrow night).

If you have any significant concerns about the above, let me know so we can 
change it.

Thanks,

Dave

As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to Heidi Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary:

Heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate.  I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.

The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.

We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.


In summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.

Dear all-

Could you all please review the attached list and see if these are any of your books (or if you know anything about them)?  If they are, could you please let me know if they should be included in the new RisktRAC hierarchy?  We ran a comparison from the active book list that I received from you all to what is currently shown as active in RisktRAC and came up with these differences.  Please let me know either way if any of these are your books so that I won't harass you anymore!  I need a response ASAP.

I appreciate your help!  Thanks,

Christy
