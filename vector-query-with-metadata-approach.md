## How to make sure metadata information is also utilised while doing the retreival from vector db?

To ensure metadata is effectively utilized during retrieval in your vector database, you need to combine semantic search with metadata-based filtering/boosting. Here’s how to do it:

### 1. Metadata Filtering  

Use metadata as a pre-filter or post-filter during retrieval to narrow down results.
Example use cases:  

- Retrieve only tables for numerical queries (e.g., “What was the 2023 revenue?”).

- Filter results by document source or page number.

**Implementation**  
Most vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma) support metadata filtering. For instance:
```python
# Filter to retrieve only tables from page 5 of a specific document
results = vector_db.query(
    query_embedding,
    filter={
        "type": {"$eq": "table"},
        "source": {"$eq": "document.pdf/p.5"}
    },
    top_k=5
)
```

### 2. Metadata Boosting

Boost the relevance score of entries with specific metadata to prioritize them in results.
Example:

- Prioritize tables for queries containing words like “sales,” “growth,” or “statistics.”

- Boost sections tagged as “financial summary” for revenue-related queries.

**Implementation**  
Some databases (e.g., Elasticsearch, Vespa) allow boosting based on metadata:

```python
# Elasticsearch example: Boost tables by 2x
query = {
    "query": {
        "hybrid": {
            "semantic": {"vector": query_embedding, "k": 10},
            "boosts": [
                {"filter": {"term": {"type": "table"}}, "value": 2.0}
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Hybrid Search (Vector + Metadata Scoring)

Combine vector similarity scores with metadata-based scoring for ranking.

Approach:

1. Compute the semantic similarity score between the query and the content.

2. Add a metadata score (e.g., 1.0 if the entry is a table and the query is numeric, 0.5 otherwise).

3. Rank results by the combined score

```python
total_score = (0.8 * semantic_score) + (0.2 * metadata_score)
```

### 4. Metadata in Embeddings

Embed metadata directly into the text representation to influence vector similarity.

**Example**  
Prepend metadata to the content before embedding:
```python
# Include metadata in the text passed to the embedder
content_with_metadata = f"[Table] Year: 2023, Sales: $500K. Source: document.pdf/p.10"
embedding = embedder.encode(content_with_metadata)
```
**Why this works**  
The model will associate the [Table] tag or Source information with the content, improving retrieval for queries like “Tables from document.pdf”.

### 5.Dynamic Metadata Weighting

Adjust metadata importance based on the query. For example:

- If the query contains “table” or “statistics,” prioritize entries with "type": "table".

- Use lightweight classifiers or regex to detect query intent.

**Implementation**
```python
def adjust_weights(query):
    if "table" in query or "statistics" in query:
        return {"type": "table", "boost": 2.0}
    else:
        return {}
```

### 6. Post-Retrieval Reranking

Use metadata to rerank retrieved results:

1. Retrieve top-k results using vector search.

2. Rerank them based on metadata relevance.

**Example**
```python
retrieved_results = vector_db.query(query_embedding, top_k=50)
reranked_results = sorted(
    retrieved_results,
    key=lambda x: x.metadata.get("relevance_score", 1.0),
    reverse=True
)[:5]
```

### 7. Metadata-Aware Indexing

Precompute metadata relationships during indexing. For example:

1. Create a secondary index mapping page_number → [chunk_ids] or document → [tables].

2. Use graph databases (Neo4j) or relational metadata stores for complex relationships.

**Tools & Libraries**  
1. **Weaviate**: Built-in hybrid search with metadata filtering.

2. **Elasticsearch**: Boosting, filtering, and scripted scoring.

3. **Chroma**: Lightweight filtering with where clauses.

4. **LangChain**: Metadata-aware retrievers (e.g., SelfQueryRetriever).

**Practical Implementation Steps**  
1. **Define Metadata Schema**: Ensure metadata fields (e.g., `type`, `source`, `page`) are standardized.

2. **Choose a Metadata-Aware Vector DB**: Use databases like Weaviate or Pinecone.

3. **Hybrid Query Design**: Combine vector search with metadata filters/boosts.

4. **Evaluate**: Test with queries requiring metadata (e.g., “Show tables from Q2 2023”).

**Example Workflow**
```python
# Step 1: Query with metadata filtering
results = vector_db.query(
    query_embedding,
    filter={"type": "table", "year": 2023},
    top_k=5
)

# Step 2: Boost tables in hybrid mode (Weaviate)
results = client.query.get("Document", ["content", "type"]).with_hybrid(
    query="2023 sales figures",
    alpha=0.5  # Balances vector and keyword/metadata relevance
).with_where({
    "path": ["type"],
    "operator": "Equal",
    "value": "table"
}).do()
```

By integrating metadata into your retrieval pipeline, you ensure the system leverages both semantic meaning and structured context, improving accuracy for queries that depend on tabular data or document-specific context.
