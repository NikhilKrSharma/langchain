Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\n\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \n\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.\n"

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; \nthe need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, \non Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic \nconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time \nconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the \ninability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the \nconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can \narrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to \nhappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the \nconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude \nbuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the \nfuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm \nrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project \nplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. \nThe other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to \nthemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this \nproject.\n\nI have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been \ngood. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now \nwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.\n\nRichard  \n---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000 \n08:34 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nAllan Severude\n10/05/2000 06:03 PM\nTo: Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott \nMills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list\n\n\nFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated \npositions, I think we still have the following issues:\nWe don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had \nthree meetings which brought out very different issues from different \ntraders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader \nrequirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.\nWe're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to \nbe outside the scope of position consolidation.\n\nThings left to do:\nI think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to \nmake it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this \nproject.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.\nGo through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this \nproject and which fall out of scope.\nFor those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and \nwork with traders to define the exact requirements of each.\nDefine the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all \ndrill downs.\nUse the above to formulate a project plan.\n\nThings requested thus far (no particular order):\nInclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal \nticker.\nCustomized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that \nadd up existing position manager rows/columns).\nNew drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, \ntransport, swaps, options, ...\nAddition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values \nof all curves on which the desk has a position.\nAbility to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be \nshown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid \nwould be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.\nAbility to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the \nappropriate positions to show for each:\nGas Daily for monthly index,\nPhysical gas for Nymex,\nPhysical gas for Inside Ferc,\nPhysical gas for Mid market.\nAbility for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of \nusing official valuations.\nPosition and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.\nAbility to include the Gas Price book into TDS:\nInclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility \nskew and correlations.\nAbility to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  \nApproximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a \ngamma grid.\nValuation of Gas Daily options.\nA new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.\nInclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.\nAbility to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position \nmanager.\nAbility to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, \nprior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.\nEliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.\nPosition drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of \nindividual deals on the position total in a grid cell.\nBenchmark positions in TDS.\nDeployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit \nand explicit position break out issues.\n\n-- Allan.\n\nPS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for \ntransport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that \npoint.\n\n\n\n\n"

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan's list; \nthe need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, \non Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic \nconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time \nconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the \ninability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the \nconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can \narrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to \nhappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the \nconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude \nbuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the \nfuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm \nrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project \nplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. \nThe other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to \nthemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this \nproject.\n\nI have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been \ngood. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now \nwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.\n\nRichard  \n---------------------- Forwarded by Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT on 10/06/2000 \n08:34 AM ---------------------------\n\n\nAllan Severude\n10/05/2000 06:03 PM\nTo: Richard Burchfield/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Peggy Alix/HOU/ECT@ECT, Russ Severson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott \nMills/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenny Ha/HOU/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Consolidated positions: Issues & To Do list\n\n\nFrom our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated \npositions, I think we still have the following issues:\nWe don't have a single point of contact from the trading group.  We've had \nthree meetings which brought out very different issues from different \ntraders.  We really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader \nrequirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.\nWe're getting hit with a lot of different requests, many of which appear to \nbe outside the scope of position consolidation.\n\nThings left to do:\nI think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to \nmake it as clear as possible what we're trying to accomplish with this \nproject.  It'll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.\nGo through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this \nproject and which fall out of scope.\nFor those in scope, work to define relative importance (priority) of each and \nwork with traders to define the exact requirements of each.\nDefine the desired lay out of the position manager screen: main view and all \ndrill downs.\nUse the above to formulate a project plan.\n\nThings requested thus far (no particular order):\nInclusion of Sitara physical deals into the TDS position manager and deal \nticker.\nCustomized rows and columns in the position manager (ad hoc rows/columns that \nadd up existing position manager rows/columns).\nNew drill down in the position manager to break out positions by: physical, \ntransport, swaps, options, ...\nAddition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values \nof all curves on which the desk has a position.\nAbility to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be \nshown directly above monthly positions.  Each grouped column in the top grid \nwould be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.\nAbility to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals; determine the \nappropriate positions to show for each:\nGas Daily for monthly index,\nPhysical gas for Nymex,\nPhysical gas for Inside Ferc,\nPhysical gas for Mid market.\nAbility for TDS to pull valuation results based on a TDS flag instead of \nusing official valuations.\nPosition and P&L aggregation across all gas desks.\nAbility to include the Gas Price book into TDS:\nInclusion of spread options in our systems.  Ability to handle volatility \nskew and correlations.\nAbility to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day.  \nApproximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a \ngamma grid.\nValuation of Gas Daily options.\nA new position screen for options (months x strike x delta).  TBD.\nInclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.\nAbility to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position \nmanager.\nAbility to view change deal P&L in the TDS deal ticker.  Show new deal terms, \nprior deal terms, and net P&L affect of the change.\nEliminate change deals with no economic impact from the TDS deal ticker.\nPosition drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of \nindividual deals on the position total in a grid cell.\nBenchmark positions in TDS.\nDeployment of TDS in Canada. Currency and volume uom conversions. Implicit \nand explicit position break out issues.\n\n-- Allan.\n\nPS: Colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for \ntransport.  Hopefully we'll know much better where that part stands at that \npoint.\n\n\n\n\n"

The land is selling for $2.50 per square\nfoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West\nSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.\n\nSeveral new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes\nand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25\nper square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and\n$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This\nproperty will have the best location for student housing of all new\nprojects, just as the duplexes do now.\n\nIf this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there\nis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not\nyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will\nknow more on this question later today.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge W.

If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\nfor 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\ncompletion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\nexpect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\nimprovement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\nirrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\ndevelopment cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\nspent no interest is charged on these funds.\n\nThe lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\nfinished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\nhigh as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\nper lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\nwhich means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\nobtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\nprovided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\nimprovement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\ncover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\nspent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\npreliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\ntentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\nsignificantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n\nPhasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\nlot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\nimprovements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\ncosts, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\nlandscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\nundeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\nestimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\nloan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\nyou a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\nof $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\nis depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\nseparate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\nstandpoint.\n\nCONSTRUCTION LOANS\nThere are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\n(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\na construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\nbuilder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\nloan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\nstart the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\nin the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\nconstruction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\ndifficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n\nSpec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\npre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\nbe from 80% to 95% of value.\n\nDISBURSEMENTS\nDisbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\nnear term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\npayments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\nwill contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\nfee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\nThese fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\ncalculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\nexpenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\nto perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\ncannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\nfunction, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\nfrom third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\nFinally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\nused in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\nany significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\nto facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\n\nREPORTING\nWe are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\nWhat did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\nreporting.\n\nBOOKKEEPING\nI am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\nprocedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\n\nINVESTOR INPUT\nWe are glad to have the investor's input on design and materials.  As always\nthe question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\nexperience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\nKeith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\neffort to be accommodating.\n\nCREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\nCB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\nformal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\nobtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\nsubs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\nfor vendors they are constantly shopped.\n\nPRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\nYes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\nprovide these if you are interested.\n\nI know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last \nnight but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said \nthis is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? \n?\nI will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at \nthat but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even \nneeded to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any \nneed to contact me regarding the  closing.\n?\nI really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself \nand I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't \nseem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my \nsignature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it \nreviewed before I accept it.\n?\nBrenda\n?\n?\n"

Now or for the land closing? Investment \nschedule?\n\n Investment Return\n\n Is Equity Repayment the return of the original investment?\n\n Is the plan to wait until the last unit is sold and closed before profits \nare distributed?\n\n Debt\n\n Which entity is the borrower for each loan and what recourse or collateral \nis associated with each \n loan?\n\n Improvement\n\n Construction\n\n Are these the only two loans?  Looks like it from the cash flow statement.\n\n Terms of each loan?\n\n Uses of Funds\n\n How will disbursements be made?  By whom?\n\n What type of bank account?  Controls on max disbursement? Internet viewing \nfor investors?\n\n Reports to track expenses vs plan?\n\n Bookkeeping procedures to record actual expenses?\n\n What is the relationship of Creekside Builders to the project?  Do you get \npaid a markup on subcontractors as a \n general contractor and paid gain out of profits?\n\n Do you or Larry receive any money in the form of salary or personal expenses \nbefore the ultimate payout of profits?\n\n Design and Construction\n \n When will design be complete?\n\n What input will investors have in selecting design and materials for units?\n\n What level of investor involvement will be possible during construction \nplanning and permitting?\n\n Does Creekside have specific procedures for dealing with subcontractors, \nvendors, and other professionals? \n Such as always getting 3 bids, payment schedules, or reference checking?\n\n Are there any specific companies or individuals that you already plan to \nuse? Names?\n\nThese questions are probably very basic to you, but as a first time investor \nin a project like this it is new to me.  Also, I want to learn as\nmuch as possible from the process.\n\nPhillip\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n "

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\nwith your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\n1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\nrental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\nbe the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\nexchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\nAntonio if you do not know anyone.\nI will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\nby Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\nOnce you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\nschedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\nyour schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\ntime.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\n512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\n512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\non this project that is sure to be a major winner.\nI regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\nevents these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\ndowndrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\nOne of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\nstart the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\nto knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\nanother week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\nmy wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\nin her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\npast week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\nthe enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\nif she will be ok in the long run.\nGeorge W.

Based on \nthe discussion, the rule contains the following major provisions:\n\nWaiver of Capacity Release Price Caps.  A waiver of the price cap on \nshort-term (1 year or less) capacity release transactions through September \n2002.  Hebert would have preferred a permanent removal of the price cap.\nSeasonal Rates.  A framework for pipelines to propose peak & off-peak rates \nfor short-term services.  Pipelines would make pro forma filings.  The \nCommission commits to act on the filings within 60 days.  There would be a \nrequirement to make a cost and revenue study after 15 mo. to demonstrate \nwhether there are overcollections as a result of the seasonal rates.  Any \novercollections would be shared 50-50 with customers.\nTerm Differentiated Rates.  Approval of the concept of term-differentiated \nrates, subject to the requirement that a pipeline would have to make a \nSection 4 filing to implement term-differentiated rates.\nOperational Provisions.  Scheduling/segmentation/penalty rules along the \nlines set forth in the NOPR, including:  (1) equality of scheduling between \ncapacity release and pipeline services, (2) standardization of segmentation \nrules, (3) moving away from \"command and control\" imbalance/OFO provisions in \nfavor of new services and better information  to manage imbalances, and (4) a \nrequirement to credit remaining penalty revenues.\nReal-time Reporting.  Transactional data would be electronically posted on a \nreal-time basis.\nRight of First Refusal.  The rule continues a ROFR for all existing long-term \ncontracts with the 5-year matching cap, subject to the following revisions: \n(1) for future contracts, only contracts of more than 1 year at maximum rates \nwill have the ROFR (i.e. discount rate contracts will not enjoy ROFR), and \n(2) on systems with incremental rates, a customer exercising ROFR may be \nrequired to match the incremental rate, but these provisions will not take \neffect until a pipeline has made a Section 4 filing to determine the correct \nrate for ROFR on a particular system.  \nNot Included in the Rule.  The rule does not have a mandatory auction \nrequirement, although voluntary auctions are discussed. The rule does not \nauthorize negotiated terms.\n\n\nClarification of Certificate Policy Statement/NOPR to Eliminate Optional \nExpedited Certificates\nThe Commission proposed to eliminate OEC in favor of a single framework for \nall Section 7 certificates.  During the\npendency of the NOPR, OEC would still enjoy a presumption that the facilities \nare in the public interest, but the factors set forth in the Policy Statement \nmay be used to rebut the presumption.\n\nWith respect to the Certificate Policy statement, the Commission generally \nsticks with the policy in the September order.  It reaffirms the no subsidy \npolicy, provides guidance on projects that are a combination \nexpansion/existing system, clarifies that Memphis clauses can still be used \nin expansion contracts (although the FERC doesn't necessarily think its the \nbest way to allocate risks), and discusses ROFR in the expansion context.  It \ndoes not appear that the clarification addresses the issue of timing of \napplicability.\n\n\nKeep in mind that this summary is based only on the open discussion.  A \nwritten copy of the rule is not yet available.  I will send a more detailed \nreview once I have seen the rule.\n\n\n",

The mature woman is meant\nto wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.\n\nI realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full\nview assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it\nonly fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me\noozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a\nlump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.\n\nAs I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the\npre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, \"Oh There you\nare!\" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so\nsure and asked what else she had to show me.\n\nI tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of\nmasking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an\noversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of\nleopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like\nTarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.\n\nI tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in\nmourning.

We started this report after switching to allocations before confirmations\n\tso we could track any possible \"holes\" in the pipe. \n\n\tSo far the new process is working well and we were thinking about discontinuing this report\n\tunless you need it for Stan's meeting?  Remember we give you the Socal Window and scheduled volumes \n\tas well as the west of thoreau scheduled volumes on the weekend notes.\n\n\tThanks. Lynn",

A group within EES is requesting recording telephone conversation, and want the ability to playback from their desktop.  I explained to them that to my understanding there were some legal issues involved, and I needed to get clarification. They were under the impression, that since their requirements are different from the traders requirements for recording, they didn't think it applied.  Could you shed a little light on Enron's policy, or if this is something that should be deferred to someone within EES legal, who might that person be?

I have added some language to your proposals, but have\nkept the intention intact.\n\nThe only additional comments that I will make are that Enron will require\n(a) a confirmatory letter from Natsource LLC that the LC posted by\nNatsource will be applicable to Natsource-Tullet (in essence a guarantee\nletter) and (b)  if an LC has already been posted, it will need to be\nmodified so that it will reflect the ability of Enron to realize under it\nfor Natsource-Tullet.  If no LC has been issued, this latter point will\nneed to be handled in any LC issued.\n\nPlease take a look at the attached and let me know if anything further.  I\nwill be checking with our personnel to confirm that Natsource LLC does not\nhave to be a signatory to this BETA.\n\n(See attached file: beta-natsource-tullet(draft5-29-01).doc)\n\nMark\nSenior Counsel, EWS\nPhone:     713-345-8897\nFacsimile: 713-646-3490\nE-Mail:      Mark.Greenberg@enron.com",

Rick Buy must report to \nSkilling and the board on the \"long\" turbine position....... thus the current \neffort.  RAC and EECC have initated a more formal process where RAC will be \nkeeping a master list of turbines for Enron (like I am currently doing) with \ninput from EECC.  Dan Shultz's team will be plugged into that effort so we \ndon't have redundant list efforts going.  \n\nMatt Gimble's list looks very detailed and specific to the LM6000 effort - I \nthink some of his data will be benefitial to the Enron Master Turbine List.  \nI will ask that Mat Tezyk and Rick Carson/RAC to coordinate.  \n\nAdditionally - I think Dan/Mat Tezyk have some turbine lists they are using \nto track manufacturing and QA checks........, I don't think those lists are \nintended to ever replace the Enron Master Turbine list.  \n\nFinally - Larry Izzo asked that Dan put a list together regarding the \nLM6000's so that he (Izzo) could interface with ESA, ENA, and RAC.  I'm sure \nthat Dan could use Matt Gimble's list, overlaying ESA's needs (if they were \nnot listed).  \n\nIn summary - If we have redundant efforts going - help me highlight them so \nwe can remove unneccessary work.  \n\nThanks for the note!

         "Gas Rule\nThe Commission voted out a draft Gas Rule today (Rm98-10/RM98-12).  Based on \nthe discussion, the rule contains the following major provisions:\n\nWaiver of Capacity Release Price Caps.  A waiver of the price cap on \nshort-term (1 year or less) capacity release transactions through September \n2002.  Hebert would have preferred a permanent removal of the price cap.\nSeasonal Rates.  A framework for pipelines to propose peak & off-peak rates \nfor short-term services.  Pipelines would make pro forma filings.  The \nCommission commits to act on the filings within 60 days.  There would be a \nrequirement to make a cost and revenue study after 15 mo. to demonstrate \nwhether there are overcollections as a result of the seasonal rates.  Any \novercollections would be shared 50-50 with customers.\nTerm Differentiated Rates.  Approval of the concept of term-differentiated \nrates, subject to the requirement that a pipeline would have to make a \nSection 4 filing to implement term-differentiated rates.\nOperational Provisions.  Scheduling/segmentation/penalty rules along the \nlines set forth in the NOPR, including:  (1) equality of scheduling between \ncapacity release and pipeline services, (2) standardization of segmentation \nrules, (3) moving away from \"command and control\" imbalance/OFO provisions in \nfavor of new services and better information  to manage imbalances, and (4) a \nrequirement to credit remaining penalty revenues.\nReal-time Reporting.  Transactional data would be electronically posted on a \nreal-time basis.\nRight of First Refusal.  The rule continues a ROFR for all existing long-term \ncontracts with the 5-year matching cap, subject to the following revisions: \n(1) for future contracts, only contracts of more than 1 year at maximum rates \nwill have the ROFR (i.e. discount rate contracts will not enjoy ROFR), and \n(2) on systems with incremental rates, a customer exercising ROFR may be \nrequired to match the incremental rate, but these provisions will not take \neffect until a pipeline has made a Section 4 filing to determine the correct \nrate for ROFR on a particular system.  \nNot Included in the Rule.  The rule does not have a mandatory auction \nrequirement, although voluntary auctions are discussed. The rule does not \nauthorize negotiated terms.\n\n\nClarification of Certificate Policy Statement/NOPR to Eliminate Optional \nExpedited Certificates\nThe Commission proposed to eliminate OEC in favor of a single framework for \nall Section 7 certificates.  During the\npendency of the NOPR, OEC would still enjoy a presumption that the facilities \nare in the public interest, but the factors set forth in the Policy Statement \nmay be used to rebut the presumption.\n\nWith respect to the Certificate Policy statement, the Commission generally \nsticks with the policy in the September order.  It reaffirms the no subsidy \npolicy, provides guidance on projects that are a combination \nexpansion/existing system, clarifies that Memphis clauses can still be used \nin expansion contracts (although the FERC doesn't necessarily think its the \nbest way to allocate risks), and discusses ROFR in the expansion context.  It \ndoes not appear that the clarification addresses the issue of timing of \napplicability.\n\n\nKeep in mind that this summary is based only on the open discussion.  A \nwritten copy of the rule is not yet available.  I will send a more detailed \nreview once I have seen the rule.",

When I  was a child in the\n1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed\nfor a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not\nso much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and\nthey did a good job.\n\nToday's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a\nfigure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she\ncan either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral\nsuit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped\nfrom Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill\ndepartment store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to\na designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.\n\nWhat choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and\nentered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first\nthing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch\nmaterial.\n\nThe  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to\nlaunch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that\nif you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected\nfrom shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a\nswipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.\n\nI fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder\nstrap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!\nEventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a\nwhile to  find the other.\n\nAt last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is\nthat   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant\nto wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.\n\nI realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full\nview assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it\nonly fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me\noozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a\nlump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.\n\nAs I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the\npre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, \"Oh There you\nare!\" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so\nsure and asked what else she had to show me.\n\nI tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of\nmasking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an\noversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of\nleopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like\nTarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.\n\nI tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in\nmourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I\nthought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.\n\nFinally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style\nbottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and\nbulge  friendly, so I bought it.\n\nWhen I got home, I read the  label which said \"Material may become\n\ntransparent in water.\" I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just\nhave to stay out of  the water!",

There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be \nheld over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC \nmeeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary \ndue to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed \nin this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  \n\nThe December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM \nand EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior \nSpecialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review \nmeetings mirror the \"preferred distribution\", which as you probably know \nsuggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should \ntherefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work \nhas been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not \nbe too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the \nmanagers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good \njumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review \nand rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing \nsuggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I \nstill have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss \nmy suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of \ncourse pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels \nthat we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my \ndirect reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda \nHerod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to \nattend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  \n\nDo you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this \nyear?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the \nyear to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in \nHouston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would \nmake sense for me to attend?

I explained to them that to my understanding there were some legal issues involved, and I needed to get clarification. They were under the impression, that since their requirements are different from the traders requirements for recording, they didn't think it applied.  Could you shed a little light on Enron's policy, or if this is something that should be deferred to someone within EES legal, who might that person be?

I have added some language to your proposals, but have\nkept the intention intact.\n\nThe only additional comments that I will make are that Enron will require\n(a) a confirmatory letter from Natsource LLC that the LC posted by\nNatsource will be applicable to Natsource-Tullet (in essence a guarantee\nletter) and (b)  if an LC has already been posted, it will need to be\nmodified so that it will reflect the ability of Enron to realize under it\nfor Natsource-Tullet.  If no LC has been issued, this latter point will\nneed to be handled in any LC issued.\n\nPlease take a look at the attached and let me know if anything further.  I\nwill be checking with our personnel to confirm that Natsource LLC does not\nhave to be a signatory to this BETA.\n\n(See attached file: beta-natsource-tullet(draft5-29-01).doc)\n\nMark\nSenior Counsel, EWS\nPhone:     713-345-8897\nFacsimile: 713-646-3490\nE-Mail:      Mark.Greenberg@enron.com",

Rick Buy must report to \nSkilling and the board on the \"long\" turbine position....... thus the current \neffort.  RAC and EECC have initated a more formal process where RAC will be \nkeeping a master list of turbines for Enron (like I am currently doing) with \ninput from EECC.  Dan Shultz's team will be plugged into that effort so we \ndon't have redundant list efforts going.  \n\nMatt Gimble's list looks very detailed and specific to the LM6000 effort - I \nthink some of his data will be benefitial to the Enron Master Turbine List.  \nI will ask that Mat Tezyk and Rick Carson/RAC to coordinate.  \n\nAdditionally - I think Dan/Mat Tezyk have some turbine lists they are using \nto track manufacturing and QA checks........, I don't think those lists are \nintended to ever replace the Enron Master Turbine list.  \n\nFinally - Larry Izzo asked that Dan put a list together regarding the \nLM6000's so that he (Izzo) could interface with ESA, ENA, and RAC.  I'm sure \nthat Dan could use Matt Gimble's list, overlaying ESA's needs (if they were \nnot listed).  \n\nIn summary - If we have redundant efforts going - help me highlight them so \nwe can remove unneccessary work.  \n\nThanks for the note!

A waiver of the price cap on \nshort-term (1 year or less) capacity release transactions through September \n2002.  Hebert would have preferred a permanent removal of the price cap.\nSeasonal Rates.  A framework for pipelines to propose peak & off-peak rates \nfor short-term services.  Pipelines would make pro forma filings.  The \nCommission commits to act on the filings within 60 days.  There would be a \nrequirement to make a cost and revenue study after 15 mo. to demonstrate \nwhether there are overcollections as a result of the seasonal rates.  Any \novercollections would be shared 50-50 with customers.\nTerm Differentiated Rates.  Approval of the concept of term-differentiated \nrates, subject to the requirement that a pipeline would have to make a \nSection 4 filing to implement term-differentiated rates.\nOperational Provisions.  Scheduling/segmentation/penalty rules along the \nlines set forth in the NOPR, including:  (1) equality of scheduling between \ncapacity release and pipeline services, (2) standardization of segmentation \nrules, (3) moving away from \"command and control\" imbalance/OFO provisions in \nfavor of new services and better information  to manage imbalances, and (4) a \nrequirement to credit remaining penalty revenues.\nReal-time Reporting.  Transactional data would be electronically posted on a \nreal-time basis.\nRight of First Refusal.  The rule continues a ROFR for all existing long-term \ncontracts with the 5-year matching cap, subject to the following revisions: \n(1) for future contracts, only contracts of more than 1 year at maximum rates \nwill have the ROFR (i.e. discount rate contracts will not enjoy ROFR), and \n(2) on systems with incremental rates, a customer exercising ROFR may be \nrequired to match the incremental rate, but these provisions will not take \neffect until a pipeline has made a Section 4 filing to determine the correct \nrate for ROFR on a particular system.  \nNot Included in the Rule.  The rule does not have a mandatory auction \nrequirement, although voluntary auctions are discussed. The rule does not \nauthorize negotiated terms.\n\n\nClarification of Certificate Policy Statement/NOPR to Eliminate Optional \nExpedited Certificates\nThe Commission proposed to eliminate OEC in favor of a single framework for \nall Section 7 certificates.  During the\npendency of the NOPR, OEC would still enjoy a presumption that the facilities \nare in the public interest, but the factors set forth in the Policy Statement \nmay be used to rebut the presumption.\n\nWith respect to the Certificate Policy statement, the Commission generally \nsticks with the policy in the September order.  It reaffirms the no subsidy \npolicy, provides guidance on projects that are a combination \nexpansion/existing system, clarifies that Memphis clauses can still be used \nin expansion contracts (although the FERC doesn't necessarily think its the \nbest way to allocate risks), and discusses ROFR in the expansion context.  It \ndoes not appear that the clarification addresses the issue of timing of \napplicability.\n\n\nKeep in mind that this summary is based only on the open discussion.  A \nwritten copy of the rule is not yet available.  I will send a more detailed \nreview once I have seen the rule.",

When I  was a child in the\n1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed\nfor a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not\nso much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and\nthey did a good job.\n\nToday's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a\nfigure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she\ncan either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral\nsuit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped\nfrom Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill\ndepartment store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to\na designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.\n\nWhat choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and\nentered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first\nthing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch\nmaterial.\n\nThe  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to\nlaunch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that\nif you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected\nfrom shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a\nswipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.\n\nI fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder\nstrap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!\nEventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a\nwhile to  find the other.\n\nAt last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is\nthat   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant\nto wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.\n\nI realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full\nview assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it\nonly fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me\noozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a\nlump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.\n\nAs I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the\npre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, \"Oh There you\nare!\" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so\nsure and asked what else she had to show me.\n\nI tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of\nmasking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an\noversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of\nleopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like\nTarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.\n\nI tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in\nmourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I\nthought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.\n\nFinally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style\nbottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and\nbulge  friendly, so I bought it.\n\nWhen I got home, I read the  label which said \"Material may become\n\ntransparent in water.\" I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just\nhave to stay out of  the water!",

There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be \nheld over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC \nmeeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary \ndue to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed \nin this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  \n\nThe December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM \nand EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior \nSpecialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review \nmeetings mirror the \"preferred distribution\", which as you probably know \nsuggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should \ntherefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work \nhas been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not \nbe too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the \nmanagers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good \njumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review \nand rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing \nsuggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I \nstill have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss \nmy suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of \ncourse pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels \nthat we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my \ndirect reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda \nHerod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to \nattend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  \n\nDo you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this \nyear?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the \nyear to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in \nHouston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would \nmake sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.  \n\n   \n\n    -Sally  \n\n\n\nMike Jordan\n11/24/2000 04:28 AM\nTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Cross calibration for Operations people globally\n\nSally\n\nI have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about \nchecking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) \nwhich raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross \ncalibration done by yourself. Can I ask what are the plans?",

A group within EES is requesting recording telephone conversation, and want the ability to playback from their desktop.  I explained to them that to my understanding there were some legal issues involved, and I needed to get clarification. They were under the impression, that since their requirements are different from the traders requirements for recording, they didn't think it applied.  Could you shed a little light on Enron's policy, or if this is something that should be deferred to someone within EES legal, who might that person be?

I have added some language to your proposals, but have\nkept the intention intact.\n\nThe only additional comments that I will make are that Enron will require\n(a) a confirmatory letter from Natsource LLC that the LC posted by\nNatsource will be applicable to Natsource-Tullet (in essence a guarantee\nletter) and (b)  if an LC has already been posted, it will need to be\nmodified so that it will reflect the ability of Enron to realize under it\nfor Natsource-Tullet.  If no LC has been issued, this latter point will\nneed to be handled in any LC issued.\n\nPlease take a look at the attached and let me know if anything further.  I\nwill be checking with our personnel to confirm that Natsource LLC does not\nhave to be a signatory to this BETA.\n\n(See attached file: beta-natsource-tullet(draft5-29-01).doc)\n\nMark\nSenior Counsel, EWS\nPhone:     713-345-8897\nFacsimile: 713-646-3490\nE-Mail:      Mark.Greenberg@enron.com",

Rick Buy must report to \nSkilling and the board on the \"long\" turbine position....... thus the current \neffort.  RAC and EECC have initated a more formal process where RAC will be \nkeeping a master list of turbines for Enron (like I am currently doing) with \ninput from EECC.  Dan Shultz's team will be plugged into that effort so we \ndon't have redundant list efforts going.  \n\nMatt Gimble's list looks very detailed and specific to the LM6000 effort - I \nthink some of his data will be benefitial to the Enron Master Turbine List.  \nI will ask that Mat Tezyk and Rick Carson/RAC to coordinate.  \n\nAdditionally - I think Dan/Mat Tezyk have some turbine lists they are using \nto track manufacturing and QA checks........, I don't think those lists are \nintended to ever replace the Enron Master Turbine list.  \n\nFinally - Larry Izzo asked that Dan put a list together regarding the \nLM6000's so that he (Izzo) could interface with ESA, ENA, and RAC.  I'm sure \nthat Dan could use Matt Gimble's list, overlaying ESA's needs (if they were \nnot listed).  \n\nIn summary - If we have redundant efforts going - help me highlight them so \nwe can remove unneccessary work.  \n\nThanks for the note!

         "Gas Rule\nThe Commission voted out a draft Gas Rule today (Rm98-10/RM98-12).  Based on \nthe discussion, the rule contains the following major provisions:\n\nWaiver of Capacity Release Price Caps.  A waiver of the price cap on \nshort-term (1 year or less) capacity release transactions through September \n2002.  Hebert would have preferred a permanent removal of the price cap.\nSeasonal Rates.  A framework for pipelines to propose peak & off-peak rates \nfor short-term services.  Pipelines would make pro forma filings.  The \nCommission commits to act on the filings within 60 days.  There would be a \nrequirement to make a cost and revenue study after 15 mo. to demonstrate \nwhether there are overcollections as a result of the seasonal rates.  Any \novercollections would be shared 50-50 with customers.\nTerm Differentiated Rates.  Approval of the concept of term-differentiated \nrates, subject to the requirement that a pipeline would have to make a \nSection 4 filing to implement term-differentiated rates.\nOperational Provisions.  Scheduling/segmentation/penalty rules along the \nlines set forth in the NOPR, including:  (1) equality of scheduling between \ncapacity release and pipeline services, (2) standardization of segmentation \nrules, (3) moving away from \"command and control\" imbalance/OFO provisions in \nfavor of new services and better information  to manage imbalances, and (4) a \nrequirement to credit remaining penalty revenues.\nReal-time Reporting.  Transactional data would be electronically posted on a \nreal-time basis.\nRight of First Refusal.  The rule continues a ROFR for all existing long-term \ncontracts with the 5-year matching cap, subject to the following revisions: \n(1) for future contracts, only contracts of more than 1 year at maximum rates \nwill have the ROFR (i.e. discount rate contracts will not enjoy ROFR), and \n(2) on systems with incremental rates, a customer exercising ROFR may be \nrequired to match the incremental rate, but these provisions will not take \neffect until a pipeline has made a Section 4 filing to determine the correct \nrate for ROFR on a particular system.  \nNot Included in the Rule.  The rule does not have a mandatory auction \nrequirement, although voluntary auctions are discussed. The rule does not \nauthorize negotiated terms.\n\n\nClarification of Certificate Policy Statement/NOPR to Eliminate Optional \nExpedited Certificates\nThe Commission proposed to eliminate OEC in favor of a single framework for \nall Section 7 certificates.  During the\npendency of the NOPR, OEC would still enjoy a presumption that the facilities \nare in the public interest, but the factors set forth in the Policy Statement \nmay be used to rebut the presumption.\n\nWith respect to the Certificate Policy statement, the Commission generally \nsticks with the policy in the September order.  It reaffirms the no subsidy \npolicy, provides guidance on projects that are a combination \nexpansion/existing system, clarifies that Memphis clauses can still be used \nin expansion contracts (although the FERC doesn't necessarily think its the \nbest way to allocate risks), and discusses ROFR in the expansion context.  It \ndoes not appear that the clarification addresses the issue of timing of \napplicability.\n\n\nKeep in mind that this summary is based only on the open discussion.  A \nwritten copy of the rule is not yet available.  I will send a more detailed \nreview once I have seen the rule.",

When I  was a child in the\n1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed\nfor a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not\nso much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and\nthey did a good job.\n\nToday's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a\nfigure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she\ncan either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral\nsuit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped\nfrom Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill\ndepartment store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to\na designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.\n\nWhat choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and\nentered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first\nthing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch\nmaterial.\n\nThe  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to\nlaunch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that\nif you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected\nfrom shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a\nswipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.\n\nI fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder\nstrap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!\nEventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a\nwhile to  find the other.\n\nAt last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is\nthat   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant\nto wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.\n\nI realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full\nview assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it\nonly fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me\noozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a\nlump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.\n\nAs I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the\npre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, \"Oh There you\nare!\" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so\nsure and asked what else she had to show me.\n\nI tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of\nmasking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an\noversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of\nleopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like\nTarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.\n\nI tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in\nmourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I\nthought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.\n\nFinally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style\nbottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and\nbulge  friendly, so I bought it.\n\nWhen I got home, I read the  label which said \"Material may become\n\ntransparent in water.\" I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just\nhave to stay out of  the water!",

Here it is...\n---------------------- Forwarded by Sally Beck/HOU/ECT on 11/27/2000 02:09 PM \n---------------------------\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Sally Beck                           11/27/2000 02:08 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Cross calibration for Operations people globally  \n\nI have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be \nheld in Houston.  There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be \nheld over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC \nmeeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary \ndue to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed \nin this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  \n\nThe December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM \nand EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior \nSpecialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review \nmeetings mirror the \"preferred distribution\", which as you probably know \nsuggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should \ntherefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work \nhas been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not \nbe too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the \nmanagers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good \njumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review \nand rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing \nsuggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I \nstill have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss \nmy suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of \ncourse pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels \nthat we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my \ndirect reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda \nHerod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to \nattend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  \n\nDo you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this \nyear?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the \nyear to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in \nHouston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would \nmake sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.  \n\n   \n\n    -Sally  \n\n\n\nMike Jordan\n11/24/2000 04:28 AM\nTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Cross calibration for Operations people globally\n\nSally\n\nI have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about \nchecking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) \nwhich raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross \ncalibration done by yourself. Can I ask what are the plans?",

If you ever need\nto  leave the  list,  you  will find  the  necessary instructions  below.\nPerhaps  more importantly,  saving a  copy of  this message  (and of  all\nfuture subscription notices  from other mailing lists) in  a special mail\nfolder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you\nare subscribed  to. This may  prove very useful the  next time you  go on\nvacation and  need to leave  the lists temporarily so  as not to  fill up\nyour  mailbox while  you  are away!  You should  also  save the  \"welcome\nmessages\" from the  list owners that you will  occasionally receive after\nsubscribing to a new list.\n\nTo send  a message to  all the people  currently subscribed to  the list,\njust send mail  to RRGA-L@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG. This is  called \"sending mail\nto the  list\", because  you send  mail to a  single address  and LISTSERV\nmakes  copies  for all  the  people  who  have subscribed.  This  address\n(RRGA-L@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG)  is also  called the  \"list address\".  You must\nnever try to send any command to that address, as it would be distributed\nto all the people  who have subscribed. All commands must  be sent to the\n\"LISTSERV  address\",   LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG.  It   is  very\nimportant to understand  the difference between the  two, but fortunately\nit is  not complicated. The  LISTSERV address is  like a FAX  number that\nconnects you  to a  machine, whereas  the list address  is like  a normal\nvoice line connecting you to a person. If you make a mistake and dial the\nFAX number  when you  wanted to talk  to someone on  the phone,  you will\nquickly realize  that you used the  wrong number and call  again. No harm\nwill have been done. If on the  other hand you accidentally make your FAX\ncall  someone's  voice  line,  the  person receiving  the  call  will  be\ninconvenienced, especially if your FAX then re-dials every 5 minutes. The\nfact that  most people  will eventually  connect the  FAX machine  to the\nvoice line to  allow the FAX to  go through and make the  calls stop does\nnot mean  that you  should continue  to send FAXes  to the  voice number.\nPeople would just get mad at you.  It works pretty much the same way with\nmailing  lists, with  the difference  that  you are  calling hundreds  or\nthousands of people  at the same time, and consequently  you can expect a\nlot of people to get upset if  you consistently send commands to the list\naddress.\n\nYou may leave the list at any  time by sending a \"SIGNOFF RRGA-L\" command\nto LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG. You can also tell LISTSERV how you\nwant it to confirm  the receipt of messages you send to  the list. If you\ndo not trust  the system, send a \"SET RRGA-L  REPRO\" command and LISTSERV\nwill send you a  copy of your own messages, so that you  can see that the\nmessage was distributed and did not get damaged on the way. After a while\nyou  may find  that this  is getting  annoying, especially  if your  mail\nprogram does not  tell you that the  message is from you  when it informs\nyou that new mail has arrived from  RRGA-L. If you send a \"SET RRGA-L ACK\nNOREPRO\" command, LISTSERV will mail you a short acknowledgement instead,\nwhich  will look  different in  your  mailbox directory.  With most  mail\nprograms you  will know immediately  that this is an  acknowledgement you\ncan read  later. Finally,  you can  turn off  acknowledgements completely\nwith \"SET RRGA-L NOACK NOREPRO\".\n\nFollowing  instructions from  the list  owner, your  subscription options\nhave been set to \"NOFILES REPRO\" rather than the usual LISTSERV defaults.\nFor more  information about subscription  options, send a  \"QUERY RRGA-L\"\ncommand to LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG.\n\nContributions sent to this list are automatically archived. You can get a\nlist of the available archive files  by sending an \"INDEX RRGA-L\" command\nto  LISTSERV@LIST.RTOWEST.ORG. You  can then  order these  files\nwith a \"GET RRGA-L LOGxxxx\"  command, or using LISTSERV's database search\nfacilities.

Anyway, \nI'm assuming you've been trying to relax as well and have some fun before \nembarking on your new career with Valero.  I'm sure your decision to leave \nEnron and move back to San Antonio will prove to be the right one.    \n\nIn regards to dinner this Friday...I would definitely like to get together \nbefore you leave.  Given how I've been feeling on Friday evenings as of late \n(monumentally exhausted), sometime earlier in the week might be better.  \nHowever, if Friday's the only time you can do it then Friday it is.  Just let \nme know what works for you.  Of course, regardless of what night it is, it's \nprobably going to have to be on the later side to accommodate Larry's lackey \n(i.e. me).\n\nSusan",

WE have nothing in the system, so I have no idea what to say to them beyond what I think is the case, that AEP has this business now.\n\nAs for the Industrial research, I got your message and I assume I should focus on the ones on the map.

I have added some language to your proposals, but have\nkept the intention intact.\n\nThe only additional comments that I will make are that Enron will require\n(a) a confirmatory letter from Natsource LLC that the LC posted by\nNatsource will be applicable to Natsource-Tullet (in essence a guarantee\nletter) and (b)  if an LC has already been posted, it will need to be\nmodified so that it will reflect the ability of Enron to realize under it\nfor Natsource-Tullet.  If no LC has been issued, this latter point will\nneed to be handled in any LC issued.\n\nPlease take a look at the attached and let me know if anything further.

Rick Buy must report to \nSkilling and the board on the \"long\" turbine position....... thus the current \neffort.  RAC and EECC have initated a more formal process where RAC will be \nkeeping a master list of turbines for Enron (like I am currently doing) with \ninput from EECC.  Dan Shultz's team will be plugged into that effort so we \ndon't have redundant list efforts going.  \n\nMatt Gimble's list looks very detailed and specific to the LM6000 effort - I \nthink some of his data will be benefitial to the Enron Master Turbine List.  \nI will ask that Mat Tezyk and Rick Carson/RAC to coordinate.  \n\nAdditionally - I think Dan/Mat Tezyk have some turbine lists they are using \nto track manufacturing and QA checks........, I don't think those lists are \nintended to ever replace the Enron Master Turbine list.  \n\nFinally - Larry Izzo asked that Dan put a list together regarding the \nLM6000's so that he (Izzo) could interface with ESA, ENA, and RAC.  I'm sure \nthat Dan could use Matt Gimble's list, overlaying ESA's needs (if they were \nnot listed).  \n\nIn summary - If we have redundant efforts going - help me highlight them so \nwe can remove unneccessary work.  \n\nThanks for the note!

         "Gas Rule\nThe Commission voted out a draft Gas Rule today (Rm98-10/RM98-12).  Based on \nthe discussion, the rule contains the following major provisions:\n\nWaiver of Capacity Release Price Caps.  A waiver of the price cap on \nshort-term (1 year or less) capacity release transactions through September \n2002.  Hebert would have preferred a permanent removal of the price cap.\nSeasonal Rates.  A framework for pipelines to propose peak & off-peak rates \nfor short-term services.  Pipelines would make pro forma filings.  The \nCommission commits to act on the filings within 60 days.  There would be a \nrequirement to make a cost and revenue study after 15 mo. to demonstrate \nwhether there are overcollections as a result of the seasonal rates.  Any \novercollections would be shared 50-50 with customers.\nTerm Differentiated Rates.  Approval of the concept of term-differentiated \nrates, subject to the requirement that a pipeline would have to make a \nSection 4 filing to implement term-differentiated rates.\nOperational Provisions.  Scheduling/segmentation/penalty rules along the \nlines set forth in the NOPR, including:  (1) equality of scheduling between \ncapacity release and pipeline services, (2) standardization of segmentation \nrules, (3) moving away from \"command and control\" imbalance/OFO provisions in \nfavor of new services and better information  to manage imbalances, and (4) a \nrequirement to credit remaining penalty revenues.\nReal-time Reporting.  Transactional data would be electronically posted on a \nreal-time basis.\nRight of First Refusal.  The rule continues a ROFR for all existing long-term \ncontracts with the 5-year matching cap, subject to the following revisions: \n(1) for future contracts, only contracts of more than 1 year at maximum rates \nwill have the ROFR (i.e. discount rate contracts will not enjoy ROFR), and \n(2) on systems with incremental rates, a customer exercising ROFR may be \nrequired to match the incremental rate, but these provisions will not take \neffect until a pipeline has made a Section 4 filing to determine the correct \nrate for ROFR on a particular system.  \nNot Included in the Rule.  The rule does not have a mandatory auction \nrequirement, although voluntary auctions are discussed. The rule does not \nauthorize negotiated terms.\n\n\nClarification of Certificate Policy Statement/NOPR to Eliminate Optional \nExpedited Certificates\nThe Commission proposed to eliminate OEC in favor of a single framework for \nall Section 7 certificates.  During the\npendency of the NOPR, OEC would still enjoy a presumption that the facilities \nare in the public interest, but the factors set forth in the Policy Statement \nmay be used to rebut the presumption.\n\nWith respect to the Certificate Policy statement, the Commission generally \nsticks with the policy in the September order.  It reaffirms the no subsidy \npolicy, provides guidance on projects that are a combination \nexpansion/existing system, clarifies that Memphis clauses can still be used \nin expansion contracts (although the FERC doesn't necessarily think its the \nbest way to allocate risks), and discusses ROFR in the expansion context.  It \ndoes not appear that the clarification addresses the issue of timing of \napplicability.\n\n\nKeep in mind that this summary is based only on the open discussion.  A \nwritten copy of the rule is not yet available.  I will send a more detailed \nreview once I have seen the rule.",

When I  was a child in the\n1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed\nfor a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not\nso much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and\nthey did a good job.\n\nToday's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a\nfigure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she\ncan either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral\nsuit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped\nfrom Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill\ndepartment store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to\na designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.\n\nWhat choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and\nentered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first\nthing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch\nmaterial.\n\nThe  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to\nlaunch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that\nif you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected\nfrom shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a\nswipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.\n\nI fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder\nstrap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!\nEventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a\nwhile to  find the other.\n\nAt last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is\nthat   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant\nto wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.\n\nI realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full\nview assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it\nonly fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me\noozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a\nlump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.\n\nAs I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the\npre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, \"Oh There you\nare!\" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so\nsure and asked what else she had to show me.\n\nI tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of\nmasking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an\noversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of\nleopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like\nTarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.\n\nI tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in\nmourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I\nthought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.\n\nFinally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style\nbottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and\nbulge  friendly, so I bought it.\n\nWhen I got home, I read the  label which said \"Material may become\n\ntransparent in water.\" I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just\nhave to stay out of  the water!",

There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be \nheld over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC \nmeeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary \ndue to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed \nin this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  \n\nThe December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM \nand EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior \nSpecialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review \nmeetings mirror the \"preferred distribution\", which as you probably know \nsuggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should \ntherefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work \nhas been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not \nbe too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the \nmanagers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good \njumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review \nand rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing \nsuggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I \nstill have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss \nmy suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of \ncourse pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels \nthat we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my \ndirect reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda \nHerod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to \nattend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  \n\nDo you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this \nyear?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the \nyear to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in \nHouston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would \nmake sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.  \n\n   \n\n    -Sally  \n\n\n\nMike Jordan\n11/24/2000 04:28 AM\nTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Cross calibration for Operations people globally\n\nSally\n\nI have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about \nchecking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) \nwhich raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross \ncalibration done by yourself.

A group within EES is requesting recording telephone conversation, and want the ability to playback from their desktop.  I explained to them that to my understanding there were some legal issues involved, and I needed to get clarification. They were under the impression, that since their requirements are different from the traders requirements for recording, they didn't think it applied.  Could you shed a little light on Enron's policy, or if this is something that should be deferred to someone within EES legal, who might that person be?

I have added some language to your proposals, but have\nkept the intention intact.\n\nThe only additional comments that I will make are that Enron will require\n(a) a confirmatory letter from Natsource LLC that the LC posted by\nNatsource will be applicable to Natsource-Tullet (in essence a guarantee\nletter) and (b)  if an LC has already been posted, it will need to be\nmodified so that it will reflect the ability of Enron to realize under it\nfor Natsource-Tullet.  If no LC has been issued, this latter point will\nneed to be handled in any LC issued.\n\nPlease take a look at the attached and let me know if anything further.  I\nwill be checking with our personnel to confirm that Natsource LLC does not\nhave to be a signatory to this BETA.\n\n(See attached file: beta-natsource-tullet(draft5-29-01).doc)\n\nMark\nSenior Counsel, EWS\nPhone:     713-345-8897\nFacsimile: 713-646-3490\nE-Mail:      Mark.Greenberg@enron.com",

Rick Buy must report to \nSkilling and the board on the \"long\" turbine position....... thus the current \neffort.  RAC and EECC have initated a more formal process where RAC will be \nkeeping a master list of turbines for Enron (like I am currently doing) with \ninput from EECC.  Dan Shultz's team will be plugged into that effort so we \ndon't have redundant list efforts going.  \n\nMatt Gimble's list looks very detailed and specific to the LM6000 effort - I \nthink some of his data will be benefitial to the Enron Master Turbine List.  \nI will ask that Mat Tezyk and Rick Carson/RAC to coordinate.  \n\nAdditionally - I think Dan/Mat Tezyk have some turbine lists they are using \nto track manufacturing and QA checks........, I don't think those lists are \nintended to ever replace the Enron Master Turbine list.  \n\nFinally - Larry Izzo asked that Dan put a list together regarding the \nLM6000's so that he (Izzo) could interface with ESA, ENA, and RAC.  I'm sure \nthat Dan could use Matt Gimble's list, overlaying ESA's needs (if they were \nnot listed).  \n\nIn summary - If we have redundant efforts going - help me highlight them so \nwe can remove unneccessary work.  \n\nThanks for the note!

         "Gas Rule\nThe Commission voted out a draft Gas Rule today (Rm98-10/RM98-12).  Based on \nthe discussion, the rule contains the following major provisions:\n\nWaiver of Capacity Release Price Caps.  A waiver of the price cap on \nshort-term (1 year or less) capacity release transactions through September \n2002.  Hebert would have preferred a permanent removal of the price cap.\nSeasonal Rates.  A framework for pipelines to propose peak & off-peak rates \nfor short-term services.  Pipelines would make pro forma filings.  The \nCommission commits to act on the filings within 60 days.  There would be a \nrequirement to make a cost and revenue study after 15 mo. to demonstrate \nwhether there are overcollections as a result of the seasonal rates.  Any \novercollections would be shared 50-50 with customers.\nTerm Differentiated Rates.  Approval of the concept of term-differentiated \nrates, subject to the requirement that a pipeline would have to make a \nSection 4 filing to implement term-differentiated rates.\nOperational Provisions.  Scheduling/segmentation/penalty rules along the \nlines set forth in the NOPR, including:  (1) equality of scheduling between \ncapacity release and pipeline services, (2) standardization of segmentation \nrules, (3) moving away from \"command and control\" imbalance/OFO provisions in \nfavor of new services and better information  to manage imbalances, and (4) a \nrequirement to credit remaining penalty revenues.\nReal-time Reporting.  Transactional data would be electronically posted on a \nreal-time basis.\nRight of First Refusal.  The rule continues a ROFR for all existing long-term \ncontracts with the 5-year matching cap, subject to the following revisions: \n(1) for future contracts, only contracts of more than 1 year at maximum rates \nwill have the ROFR (i.e. discount rate contracts will not enjoy ROFR), and \n(2) on systems with incremental rates, a customer exercising ROFR may be \nrequired to match the incremental rate, but these provisions will not take \neffect until a pipeline has made a Section 4 filing to determine the correct \nrate for ROFR on a particular system.  \nNot Included in the Rule.  The rule does not have a mandatory auction \nrequirement, although voluntary auctions are discussed. The rule does not \nauthorize negotiated terms.\n\n\nClarification of Certificate Policy Statement/NOPR to Eliminate Optional \nExpedited Certificates\nThe Commission proposed to eliminate OEC in favor of a single framework for \nall Section 7 certificates.  During the\npendency of the NOPR, OEC would still enjoy a presumption that the facilities \nare in the public interest, but the factors set forth in the Policy Statement \nmay be used to rebut the presumption.\n\nWith respect to the Certificate Policy statement, the Commission generally \nsticks with the policy in the September order.  It reaffirms the no subsidy \npolicy, provides guidance on projects that are a combination \nexpansion/existing system, clarifies that Memphis clauses can still be used \nin expansion contracts (although the FERC doesn't necessarily think its the \nbest way to allocate risks), and discusses ROFR in the expansion context.  It \ndoes not appear that the clarification addresses the issue of timing of \napplicability.\n\n\nKeep in mind that this summary is based only on the open discussion.  A \nwritten copy of the rule is not yet available.  I will send a more detailed \nreview once I have seen the rule.",

When I  was a child in the\n1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed\nfor a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not\nso much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and\nthey did a good job.\n\nToday's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a\nfigure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she\ncan either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral\nsuit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped\nfrom Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill\ndepartment store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to\na designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.\n\nWhat choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and\nentered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first\nthing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch\nmaterial.\n\nThe  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to\nlaunch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that\nif you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected\nfrom shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a\nswipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.\n\nI fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder\nstrap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!\nEventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a\nwhile to  find the other.\n\nAt last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is\nthat   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant\nto wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.\n\nI realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full\nview assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it\nonly fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me\noozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a\nlump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.\n\nAs I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the\npre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, \"Oh There you\nare!\" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so\nsure and asked what else she had to show me.\n\nI tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of\nmasking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an\noversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of\nleopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like\nTarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.\n\nI tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in\nmourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I\nthought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.\n\nFinally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style\nbottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and\nbulge  friendly, so I bought it.\n\nWhen I got home, I read the  label which said \"Material may become\n\ntransparent in water.\" I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just\nhave to stay out of  the water!",

Here it is...\n---------------------- Forwarded by Sally Beck/HOU/ECT on 11/27/2000 02:09 PM \n---------------------------\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Sally Beck                           11/27/2000 02:08 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Mike Jordan/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Re: Cross calibration for Operations people globally  \n\nI have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be \nheld in Houston.  There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be \nheld over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC \nmeeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary \ndue to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed \nin this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  \n\nThe December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM \nand EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior \nSpecialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review \nmeetings mirror the \"preferred distribution\", which as you probably know \nsuggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should \ntherefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work \nhas been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not \nbe too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the \nmanagers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good \njumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review \nand rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing \nsuggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I \nstill have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss \nmy suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of \ncourse pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels \nthat we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my \ndirect reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda \nHerod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to \nattend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  \n\nDo you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this \nyear?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the \nyear to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in \nHouston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would \nmake sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.  \n\n   \n\n    -Sally  \n\n\n\nMike Jordan\n11/24/2000 04:28 AM\nTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Cross calibration for Operations people globally\n\nSally\n\nI have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about \nchecking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) \nwhich raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross \ncalibration done by yourself. Can I ask what are the plans?",

A group within EES is requesting recording telephone conversation, and want the ability to playback from their desktop.  I explained to them that to my understanding there were some legal issues involved, and I needed to get clarification. They were under the impression, that since their requirements are different from the traders requirements for recording, they didn't think it applied.  Could you shed a little light on Enron's policy, or if this is something that should be deferred to someone within EES legal, who might that person be?  Any help you could offer would be very much appreciated.  Thanks for your time.\n \nRegards,\n \nKathy \n \nKathy W.

I have added some language to your proposals, but have\nkept the intention intact.\n\nThe only additional comments that I will make are that Enron will require\n(a) a confirmatory letter from Natsource LLC that the LC posted by\nNatsource will be applicable to Natsource-Tullet (in essence a guarantee\nletter) and (b)  if an LC has already been posted, it will need to be\nmodified so that it will reflect the ability of Enron to realize under it\nfor Natsource-Tullet.  If no LC has been issued, this latter point will\nneed to be handled in any LC issued.\n\nPlease take a look at the attached and let me know if anything further.  I\nwill be checking with our personnel to confirm that Natsource LLC does not\nhave to be a signatory to this BETA.\n\n(See attached file: beta-natsource-tullet(draft5-29-01).doc)\n\nMark\nSenior Counsel, EWS\nPhone:     713-345-8897\nFacsimile: 713-646-3490\nE-Mail:      Mark.Greenberg@enron.com\n<<<BODY END>>>",

Rick Buy must report to \nSkilling and the board on the \"long\" turbine position....... thus the current \neffort.  RAC and EECC have initated a more formal process where RAC will be \nkeeping a master list of turbines for Enron (like I am currently doing) with \ninput from EECC.  Dan Shultz's team will be plugged into that effort so we \ndon't have redundant list efforts going.  \n\nMatt Gimble's list looks very detailed and specific to the LM6000 effort - I \nthink some of his data will be benefitial to the Enron Master Turbine List.  \nI will ask that Mat Tezyk and Rick Carson/RAC to coordinate.  \n\nAdditionally - I think Dan/Mat Tezyk have some turbine lists they are using \nto track manufacturing and QA checks........, I don't think those lists are \nintended to ever replace the Enron Master Turbine list.  \n\nFinally - Larry Izzo asked that Dan put a list together regarding the \nLM6000's so that he (Izzo) could interface with ESA, ENA, and RAC.  I'm sure \nthat Dan could use Matt Gimble's list, overlaying ESA's needs (if they were \nnot listed).  \n\nIn summary - If we have redundant efforts going - help me highlight them so \nwe can remove unneccessary work.  \n\nThanks for the note!

         "<<<SUBJECT START>>\nFERC Meeting Today - New Gas Rule<<<\nSUBJECT END>>>\n\n<<<BODY START>>>\nGas Rule\nThe Commission voted out a draft Gas Rule today (Rm98-10/RM98-12).  Based on \nthe discussion, the rule contains the following major provisions:\n\nWaiver of Capacity Release Price Caps.  A waiver of the price cap on \nshort-term (1 year or less) capacity release transactions through September \n2002.  Hebert would have preferred a permanent removal of the price cap.\nSeasonal Rates.  A framework for pipelines to propose peak & off-peak rates \nfor short-term services.  Pipelines would make pro forma filings.  The \nCommission commits to act on the filings within 60 days.  There would be a \nrequirement to make a cost and revenue study after 15 mo. to demonstrate \nwhether there are overcollections as a result of the seasonal rates.  Any \novercollections would be shared 50-50 with customers.\nTerm Differentiated Rates.  Approval of the concept of term-differentiated \nrates, subject to the requirement that a pipeline would have to make a \nSection 4 filing to implement term-differentiated rates.\nOperational Provisions.  Scheduling/segmentation/penalty rules along the \nlines set forth in the NOPR, including:  (1) equality of scheduling between \ncapacity release and pipeline services, (2) standardization of segmentation \nrules, (3) moving away from \"command and control\" imbalance/OFO provisions in \nfavor of new services and better information  to manage imbalances, and (4) a \nrequirement to credit remaining penalty revenues.\nReal-time Reporting.  Transactional data would be electronically posted on a \nreal-time basis.\nRight of First Refusal.  The rule continues a ROFR for all existing long-term \ncontracts with the 5-year matching cap, subject to the following revisions: \n(1) for future contracts, only contracts of more than 1 year at maximum rates \nwill have the ROFR (i.e. discount rate contracts will not enjoy ROFR), and \n(2) on systems with incremental rates, a customer exercising ROFR may be \nrequired to match the incremental rate, but these provisions will not take \neffect until a pipeline has made a Section 4 filing to determine the correct \nrate for ROFR on a particular system.  \nNot Included in the Rule.  The rule does not have a mandatory auction \nrequirement, although voluntary auctions are discussed. The rule does not \nauthorize negotiated terms.\n\n\nClarification of Certificate Policy Statement/NOPR to Eliminate Optional \nExpedited Certificates\nThe Commission proposed to eliminate OEC in favor of a single framework for \nall Section 7 certificates.  During the\npendency of the NOPR, OEC would still enjoy a presumption that the facilities \nare in the public interest, but the factors set forth in the Policy Statement \nmay be used to rebut the presumption.\n\nWith respect to the Certificate Policy statement, the Commission generally \nsticks with the policy in the September order.  It reaffirms the no subsidy \npolicy, provides guidance on projects that are a combination \nexpansion/existing system, clarifies that Memphis clauses can still be used \nin expansion contracts (although the FERC doesn't necessarily think its the \nbest way to allocate risks), and discusses ROFR in the expansion context.  It \ndoes not appear that the clarification addresses the issue of timing of \napplicability.\n\n\nKeep in mind that this summary is based only on the open discussion.  A \nwritten copy of the rule is not yet available.  I will send a more detailed \nreview once I have seen the rule.\n<<<BODY END>>>",

When I  was a child in the\n1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed\nfor a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not\nso much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and\nthey did a good job.\n\nToday's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a\nfigure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she\ncan either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral\nsuit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped\nfrom Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill\ndepartment store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to\na designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.\n\nWhat choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and\nentered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first\nthing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch\nmaterial.\n\nThe  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to\nlaunch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that\nif you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected\nfrom shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a\nswipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.\n\nI fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder\nstrap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!\nEventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a\nwhile to  find the other.\n\nAt last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is\nthat   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant\nto wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.\n\nI realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full\nview assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it\nonly fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me\noozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a\nlump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.\n\nAs I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the\npre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, \"Oh There you\nare!\" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so\nsure and asked what else she had to show me.\n\nI tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of\nmasking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an\noversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of\nleopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like\nTarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.\n\nI tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in\nmourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I\nthought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.\n\nFinally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style\nbottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and\nbulge  friendly, so I bought it.\n\nWhen I got home, I read the  label which said \"Material may become\n\ntransparent in water.\" I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just\nhave to stay out of  the water!\n<<<BODY END>>>",

I have asked that the results from the pre-review \nmeetings mirror the \"preferred distribution\", which as you probably know \nsuggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should \ntherefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work \nhas been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not \nbe too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the \nmanagers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good \njumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review \nand rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing \nsuggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I \nstill have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss \nmy suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of \ncourse pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels \nthat we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my \ndirect reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda \nHerod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to \nattend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  \n\nDo you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this \nyear?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the \nyear to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in \nHouston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would \nmake sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.  \n\n   \n\n    -Sally  \n\n\n\nMike Jordan\n11/24/2000 04:28 AM\nTo: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Cross calibration for Operations people globally\n\nSally\n\nI have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about \nchecking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) \nwhich raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross \ncalibration done by yourself. Can I ask what are the plans?\n<<<BODY END>>>",

A group within EES is requesting recording telephone conversation, and want the ability to playback from their desktop.  I explained to them that to my understanding there were some legal issues involved, and I needed to get clarification. They were under the impression, that since their requirements are different from the traders requirements for recording, they didn't think it applied.  Could you shed a little light on Enron's policy, or if this is something that should be deferred to someone within EES legal, who might that person be?  Any help you could offer would be very much appreciated.  Thanks for your time.\n \nRegards,\n \nKathy \n \nKathy W.

A group within EES is requesting recording telephone conversation, and want the ability to playback from their desktop.  I explained to them that to my understanding there were some legal issues involved, and I needed to get clarification. They were under the impression, that since their requirements are different from the traders requirements for recording, they didn't think it applied.  Could you shed a little light on Enron's policy, or if this is something that should be deferred to someone within EES legal, who might that person be?  Any help you could offer would be very much appreciated.  Thanks for your time.\n \nRegards,\n \nKathy \n \nKathy W.

I have added some language to your proposals, but have\nkept the intention intact.\n\nThe only additional comments that I will make are that Enron will require\n(a) a confirmatory letter from Natsource LLC that the LC posted by\nNatsource will be applicable to Natsource-Tullet (in essence a guarantee\nletter) and (b)  if an LC has already been posted, it will need to be\nmodified so that it will reflect the ability of Enron to realize under it\nfor Natsource-Tullet.  If no LC has been issued, this latter point will\nneed to be handled in any LC issued.\n\nPlease take a look at the attached and let me know if anything further.  I\nwill be checking with our personnel to confirm that Natsource LLC does not\nhave to be a signatory to this BETA.\n\n(See attached file: beta-natsource-tullet(draft5-29-01).doc)\n\nMark\nSenior Counsel, EWS\nPhone:     713-345-8897\nFacsimile: 713-646-3490\nE-Mail:      Mark.Greenberg@enron.com\n<<<BODY END>>>",

Rick Buy must report to \nSkilling and the board on the \"long\" turbine position....... thus the current \neffort.  RAC and EECC have initated a more formal process where RAC will be \nkeeping a master list of turbines for Enron (like I am currently doing) with \ninput from EECC.  Dan Shultz's team will be plugged into that effort so we \ndon't have redundant list efforts going.  \n\nMatt Gimble's list looks very detailed and specific to the LM6000 effort - I \nthink some of his data will be benefitial to the Enron Master Turbine List.  \nI will ask that Mat Tezyk and Rick Carson/RAC to coordinate.  \n\nAdditionally - I think Dan/Mat Tezyk have some turbine lists they are using \nto track manufacturing and QA checks........, I don't think those lists are \nintended to ever replace the Enron Master Turbine list.  \n\nFinally - Larry Izzo asked that Dan put a list together regarding the \nLM6000's so that he (Izzo) could interface with ESA, ENA, and RAC.  I'm sure \nthat Dan could use Matt Gimble's list, overlaying ESA's needs (if they were \nnot listed).  \n\nIn summary - If we have redundant efforts going - help me highlight them so \nwe can remove unneccessary work.  \n\nThanks for the note!

         "<<<SUBJECT START>>\nFERC Meeting Today - New Gas Rule<<<\nSUBJECT END>>>\n\n<<<BODY START>>>\nGas Rule\nThe Commission voted out a draft Gas Rule today (Rm98-10/RM98-12).  Based on \nthe discussion, the rule contains the following major provisions:\n\nWaiver of Capacity Release Price Caps.  A waiver of the price cap on \nshort-term (1 year or less) capacity release transactions through September \n2002.  Hebert would have preferred a permanent removal of the price cap.\nSeasonal Rates.  A framework for pipelines to propose peak & off-peak rates \nfor short-term services.  Pipelines would make pro forma filings.  The \nCommission commits to act on the filings within 60 days.  There would be a \nrequirement to make a cost and revenue study after 15 mo. to demonstrate \nwhether there are overcollections as a result of the seasonal rates.  Any \novercollections would be shared 50-50 with customers.\nTerm Differentiated Rates.  Approval of the concept of term-differentiated \nrates, subject to the requirement that a pipeline would have to make a \nSection 4 filing to implement term-differentiated rates.\nOperational Provisions.  Scheduling/segmentation/penalty rules along the \nlines set forth in the NOPR, including:  (1) equality of scheduling between \ncapacity release and pipeline services, (2) standardization of segmentation \nrules, (3) moving away from \"command and control\" imbalance/OFO provisions in \nfavor of new services and better information  to manage imbalances, and (4) a \nrequirement to credit remaining penalty revenues.\nReal-time Reporting.  Transactional data would be electronically posted on a \nreal-time basis.\nRight of First Refusal.  The rule continues a ROFR for all existing long-term \ncontracts with the 5-year matching cap, subject to the following revisions: \n(1) for future contracts, only contracts of more than 1 year at maximum rates \nwill have the ROFR (i.e. discount rate contracts will not enjoy ROFR), and \n(2) on systems with incremental rates, a customer exercising ROFR may be \nrequired to match the incremental rate, but these provisions will not take \neffect until a pipeline has made a Section 4 filing to determine the correct \nrate for ROFR on a particular system.  \nNot Included in the Rule.  The rule does not have a mandatory auction \nrequirement, although voluntary auctions are discussed. The rule does not \nauthorize negotiated terms.\n\n\nClarification of Certificate Policy Statement/NOPR to Eliminate Optional \nExpedited Certificates\nThe Commission proposed to eliminate OEC in favor of a single framework for \nall Section 7 certificates.  During the\npendency of the NOPR, OEC would still enjoy a presumption that the facilities \nare in the public interest, but the factors set forth in the Policy Statement \nmay be used to rebut the presumption.\n\nWith respect to the Certificate Policy statement, the Commission generally \nsticks with the policy in the September order.  It reaffirms the no subsidy \npolicy, provides guidance on projects that are a combination \nexpansion/existing system, clarifies that Memphis clauses can still be used \nin expansion contracts (although the FERC doesn't necessarily think its the \nbest way to allocate risks), and discusses ROFR in the expansion context.  It \ndoes not appear that the clarification addresses the issue of timing of \napplicability.\n\n\nKeep in mind that this summary is based only on the open discussion.  A \nwritten copy of the rule is not yet available.  I will send a more detailed \nreview once I have seen the rule.\n<<<BODY END>>>",

When I  was a child in the\n1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed\nfor a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not\nso much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and\nthey did a good job.\n\nToday's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a\nfigure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she\ncan either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral\nsuit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped\nfrom Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill\ndepartment store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to\na designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.\n\nWhat choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and\nentered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first\nthing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch\nmaterial.\n\nThe  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to\nlaunch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that\nif you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected\nfrom shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a\nswipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.\n\nI fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder\nstrap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!\nEventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a\nwhile to  find the other.\n\nAt last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is\nthat   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant\nto wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.\n\nI realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full\nview assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it\nonly fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me\noozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a\nlump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.\n\nAs I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the\npre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, \"Oh There you\nare!\" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so\nsure and asked what else she had to show me.\n\nI tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of\nmasking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an\noversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of\nleopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like\nTarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.\n\nI tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in\nmourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I\nthought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.\n\nFinally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style\nbottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and\nbulge  friendly, so I bought it.\n\nWhen I got home, I read the  label which said \"Material may become\n\ntransparent in water.\" I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just\nhave to stay out of  the water!\n<<<BODY END>>>",

There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be \nheld over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC \nmeeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary \ndue to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed \nin this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  \n\nThe December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM \nand EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior \nSpecialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review \nmeetings mirror the \"preferred distribution\", which as you probably know \nsuggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should \ntherefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work \nhas been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not \nbe too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the \nmanagers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good \njumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review \nand rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing \nsuggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I \nstill have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss \nmy suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of \ncourse pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels \nthat we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my \ndirect reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda \nHerod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to \nattend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  \n\nDo you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this \nyear?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the \nyear to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in \nHouston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would \nmake sense for me to attend?

The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. \nUnder the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. \nFurther terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. \nMEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, \"We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.\" \nRegent President John Ehrman said, \"The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.\" \nThe producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. \nRecently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.\n<<<BODY END>>>",

His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch\na TD pass.\n\nJerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nThe loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis'\noutput over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him\nevery week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent\nTitans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats\nand may even find the end zone.\n\nCurtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nExpect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been\nvery soft all year long.\n\nKordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nWhile the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is\nstill far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a\nweak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use\nhim if you're desperate for a starter in your league.\n\nDarrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nJackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use\ntheir passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander,\nand Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.\n\nTim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nRaiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield\nin their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your\nactive lineup this week.\n\nCharlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nDon't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.\nTyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the\nrun. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.\n\nDavid Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nPatten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has\nbeen inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the\nwideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you\nshould consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.\n\nTroy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nBrown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has\nonly gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect\nanother solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.\n\nAntowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nSmith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season.\nHe'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we\nrecommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.\n\nOronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nGadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you\nuse him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you\nconsider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the\nseason.\n\nJames McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nThere is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few\nlong passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep\nleagues.\n\nTravis Minor, RB MIA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nThe Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the\ndefense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills\nhave been weak against the run all season.\n\nTony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nGonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While\nhe has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every\nweek.\n\nStephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nDavis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the\nend zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but\nyou may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running\nback depth around the league. \n\nLarry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nParker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'\nsecondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He\nmight make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.\n\nTony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nRichardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and\nthere's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas\nCity should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep\nleague or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your\nlineup.\n\nPriest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nThe Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday,\nwhich should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We\nrecommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against\nthe Jets in Week Nine.\n\nTrent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nGreen and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should\nrebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against\nthis questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less\nmistake-prone quarterback.\n\nStephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nAccording to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Alexander will be back in the\nstarting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent\nprior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a\ngamble. \n\nKyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nBrady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't\nrecommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this\nis the game he will break his slump.\n\nRod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nGardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some\ntrouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia\nsecondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective. \n\nKeenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nMcCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore,\nand that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at\nquarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat\nStarks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for\nexplosive stats.\n\nJimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nDespite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to\nkeep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less\nimpressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes\nthan most receivers in the league.\n\nElvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nThere's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing\nthe Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this\nweek if you have no other options at running back.\n\nMarcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nPollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance\nSchulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight\nend in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However,\nyou should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.\n\nTerrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nWilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday\nagainst San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way\nand post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend\nyou use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.\n\nMarvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nHarrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent.\nHowever, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer\ndownfield for great stats this week.\n\nDominic Rhodes, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nRhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should\ndefinitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats,\nbut should give good rushing totals and a score.\n\nDesmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nClark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in\nrecent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game\nThursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend\nthese two tight ends, if you need to start one it should definitely be\nClark.\n\nDwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nCarswell might factor into the Broncos' passing game more Thursday against\nDallas due to a thin corps at wide receiver. However, he had no catches in\nsimilar circumstances in Week 10, and the Cowboys will be ready to defend\nshort passes to him. Only use Carswell if you're thin at the tight end\nposition.\n\nKeith Poole, WR DEN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nIf Rod Smith indeed misses Thursday's game against Dallas, Poole will need\nto step up as the Broncos' top receiving target. However, we don't\nrecommend you use him in a Fantasy league until he first proves himself a\nreliable point-producer. Keep Poole reserved against Dallas.\n\nKevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nDon't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. he has been inconsistent\nthis season, and may not do much against a physical Pittsburgh defense.\n\nDerrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nMason should post respectable statistics against the Steelers. Don't expect\nhim to be intimidated by the Pittsburgh defense.\n\nMike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nAlstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't\nexpect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,\nscoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. \n\nBrad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nJohnson threw for 399 yards last week against Chicago, but he also threw no\ntouchdowns and was picked off twice. He's been unreliable from a Fantasy\nstandpoint, and is a gamble even when the matchup is in his favor. \n\nKeyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nJohnson had a big game against Chicago last weekend, catching 12 passes for\n89 yards. He was held out of the end zone again, but look for that to\nchange on Monday night against St. Louis. \n\nAz-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nHakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New\nEngland. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,\nso avoid starting him if at all possible. \n\nTorry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nHolt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last weekend against\nNew England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the league, and is\nworth starting on a weekly basis. \n\nIsaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nBruce had a huge game against New England last weekend, posting seven\ncatches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid game in Week 11 against\na Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big play. \n\nOlandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nGary will likely get a fair number of carries Thursday against Dallas, but\nwe don't expect him to provide useful Fantasy stats. The Cowboys will\nprobably focus on the run, which makes both Gary and Mike Anderson risky\nstarts this week since they have been splitting time.\n\nBrian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nWith favorite target Rod Smith likely sidelined by injury, Griese will have\nquestionable receivers to work with Thursday against Dallas. However, the\nCowboys' defense will probably focus on the run and force Griese to beat\nthem through the air. He should provide your team with decent stats and is\nworth using this week.\n\nMarshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nFaulk had 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against New England last\nweekend. He's the best player in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in\nany league format. \n\nJamel White, RB CLE - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nThe Browns may use White as a change-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar\nBengals run defense. You might want to consider him as a third running back\noption on your team if you're lacking in starting options.\n\nErnie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nConwell has had a few down weeks, and is now listed as questionable for\nMonday's game against Tampa Bay due to a shoulder injury. With the lack of\ndepth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is\nsomething many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do if he's\nhealthy. \n\nKurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nWarner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401\nyards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and\nwill throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent\nsecondary. \n\nO.J. Santiago, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nSantiago catches the occasional pass for the Browns and could find the end\nzone every now or then. He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati\nsecondary, so maybe this is one of the rare weeks he scores. Only use\nSantiago if you're desperate for a tight end, however, as he rarely gets a\nbig yardage total.\n\nKevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nJohnson has been a prime target for Tim Couch in the Cleveland passing game\nthis season, and is now a very reliable No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver.\nJohnson is on a real hot streak and has a good career record against the\nBengals, his opponent for this week, so get him into your lineup.\n\nTim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nCouch has a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards,\nfour TDs), whom he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks\nyou could choose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week,\ngive him a look.\n\nPeter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nWarrick has been catching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't\nprovided stats worthy of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league.\nHis matchup against Cleveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him\nreserved this week.\n\nDarnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nAlthough Scott has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last two games\nagainst the Browns, whom he plays Sunday, we can't recommend you use him\nthis week. He has been far too inconsistent and a real disappointment from\na Fantasy perspective.\n\nJon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nWe can't advise you use Kitna as he goes up against the Browns' secondary\nthis week. Cleveland has been very stingy against the pass all year,\nleading the league in interceptions and ranking ninth overall in sacks.\n\nCorey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01\nDefinitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the\nBrowns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678\nrushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in\nyour active lineup week in and week out in any league.\n\nLarry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nCenters has been a great pass-catching back for the Bills this season, but\nhe will face a Miami defense on Sunday that will likely be able to contain\nhim. Only use him if you have no other alternative on your bench.\n\nPeerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nPrice has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recent weeks,\nlogging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a bigger\nchallenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reserving him.\n\nEric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nThere's a good chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week\nagainst a solid Miami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent\nlimited role in the Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he\nhas a good history against the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and\nhe might be worth using as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.\n\nEric Johnson, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nJohnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against Carolina.\nUnless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't really worth\nstarting at this point. \n\nJ.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nStokes had a solid game last weekend, catching eight passes for 72 yards\nand two touchdowns against Carolina. He's been very unreliable overall,\nhowever, so starting him is still a risky move. \n\nTravis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nHenry had a very disappointing game against the Seahawks in Week 10, and\nwill likely struggle again against the far-better Dolphins defense on\nSunday. He has been far too inconsistent to merit using this week.\n\nAlex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nVan Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a\nstrong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar\nSeahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this\nweek despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the\nbench for Week 11.\n\nTravis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nAfter a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self.\nWe don't expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars, so\ndon't use him this week.\n\nShannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nSharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving\ntouchdown on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced\nJacksonville, and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe\ninto your active lineup every week.\n\nQadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nIsmail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly\ndeveloping into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot\nstreak and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you\nget Ismail into your starting lineup this week.\n\nCorrell Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nBuckhalter will return from suspension this weekend, and will be available\nfor Sunday's game against Washington. Duce Staley has established himself\nas the Eagles' featured back, so starting Buckhalter is a gamble. \n\nDuce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nStaley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in\nPhiladelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes\nhim worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. \n\nJames Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nJust when you think Thrash is reliable, he puts up two catches for 17 yards\nlike he did last weekend against Dallas. Thrash will still be in the\nstarting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams, but he's a gamble nonetheless. \n\nRon Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01\nDayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.\nHe may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for\nFantasy owners overall. \n\nTiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nBarber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a\ntouchdown in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run\nthis season, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their\noffense in Week 11. \n\nIke Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nHilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a\nsore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,\nhowever, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. \n\nAmani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nToomer caught five balls for 60 yards against Minnesota on Monday night,\nbut he'll struggle to post similar numbers vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a\nformidable secondary, so benching Toomer in smaller Fantasy leagues is a\nwise move. \n\nKerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01\nCollins had a solid game yardage-wise against Minnesota, throwing for 321\nyards on Monday night. However, he has had trouble getting the ball into\nthe end zone consistently, which makes him a risky Fantasy player. As a\nresult, benching him in Week 11 against Oakland is advisable. \n\nWillie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01\nJackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a Fantasy player, but he does\nhave the potential to post great numbers every week. If you play in a\ndeeper league, it's worth taking a gamble on Jackson against New England. \n\nJoe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nHorn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries, but he's been playing\nthrough them quite well. In fact, Horn has 14 catches for 247 yards and two\ntouchdowns in his last two games, and is a must-start in Week 11 against\nNew England based on his potential to post huge numbers. \n\nMichael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nBennett is proving all the critics right who said he wasn't ready for the\nNFL style of game. He's been a huge Fantasy disappointment and is barely\nworth a roster spot at this point. He'll do nothing against Chicago's\naggressive run defense, so don't bother starting him. \n\nDaunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nCulpepper finally had a breakout game last week, connecting on four\ntouchdown passes against the N.Y. Giants. He should have success against\nChicago's secondary on Sunday, so be sure to include him when you choose\nyour Week 11 starting lineup. \n\nCris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nCarter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against\nthe Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should\nhave another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is\nranked last in the league. \n\nJerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nThe Colts placed Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday with a damaged ligament\nin his right foot, effectively ending his season. He will undergo surgery\nin the near future, and you should cut him if you were holding onto him\nawaiting his return.\n\nTerry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nGlenn did not practice Tuesday or participate in the pre-practice\nwalkthrough on Wednesday, according to published reports. He is unlikely to\nplay Sunday against New Orleans and shouldn't be on anyone's Fantasy roster\nat this point.\n\nByron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nChamberlain locked up his right knee on Monday night against the N.Y.\nGiants, but he's expected to play this weekend vs. Chicago. Chamberlain has\nbeen unreliable of late, and getting open against Chicago's tough\nlinebacking group won't be an easy task. \n\nAhman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nGreen had a huge game against Detroit back in Week One, rushing for 157\nyards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 against those same\nLions, whose defense is questionable at best. \n\nBrett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nFavre had a somewhat rough outing last weekend, throwing three\ninterceptions against Atlanta. However, he's still one of the best Fantasy\nquarterbacks in the league, and he should bounce back on Thanksgiving\nagainst Detroit. \n\nAntonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nFreeman has been solid of late, catching four touchdown passes in his last\nfive games. He's a must start against Detroit's vulnerable pass defense in\nWeek 11. \n\nBubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nFranks has cooled off considerably in recent weeks, but his potential to\nfind the end zone still makes him a good Fantasy player. Unless you have a\nbetter option, starting Franks is advisable. \n\nBill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nSchroeder caught four passes for 55 yards and a touchdown last weekend\nagainst Atlanta. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy receivers in\nthe league, and should have a huge game vs. Detroit's weak secondary. \n\nCharlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nBatch had a huge game against Arizona last weekend, but he's been\ninconsistent this season for the most part. He's better off used when the\nmatchup is right, so facing a tough Green Bay defense may not bode well for\nhis Fantasy numbers.\n\nJohnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nMorton had a big game against Arizona last weekend, and has been a\nsurprisingly reliable Fantasy player this season. He may struggle against\nGreen Bay's tough pass defense, but he's still worth taking a gamble on in\nWeek 11. \n\nDesmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nHoward is not expected to miss an extended period of time due to his\nshoulder injury. He hasn't practitced this week, however, and is listed as\ndoubtful for Thursday's game against Green Bay. \n\nBert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nEmanuel, who suffered a sprained left knee during last weekend's game\nagainst Arizona, will miss at least four weeks of action. There was a\nchance that he'd be out for the season, but now he's expected to return in\nmid-to-late December. \n\nJames Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nStewart (ankle) practiced on Tuesday and feels as though he's ready to\nreturn to action. \"I feel pretty good,\" Stewart told the <I>Detroit Free\nPress</I>. \"It felt better than I thought. I'm just going to see, let (the\nmedical staff and coach Marty Mornhinweg) decide whether I play or not.\"\nHis carries may be down a bit in his first game back, but he's worth\nstarting in deeper leagues, barring any setbacks. \n\nTroy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nHambrick will return to fullback/backup duties on Thursday against Denver.\nWith Emmitt Smith expected to play, Hambrick isn't worth starting on your\nFantasy team in Week 11. \n\nJoey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nGalloway is a shell of his former self, catching only 24 passes through his\nfirst seven games this season. Dallas' pathetic quarterbacks have been the\nreal reason for Galloway's subpar numbers, making him a huge gamble from a\nFantasy perspective. Unless you're desperate, don't consider starting\nGalloway in Week 11. \n\nRaghib Ismail, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nIsmail has been Dallas' most consistent receiver, but starting him is still\na gamble from a Fantasy perspective. Dallas has the worst pass offense in\nthe league, so playing Ismail isn't advisable unless you're desperate. \n\nJim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nMiller put up solid numbers last weekend against Tampa Bay, throwing for\n228 yards and three touchdowns. Miller has been inconsistent this season,\nbut starting him in Week 11 against a shaky Minnesota secondary is\ndefinitely worth considering.\n\nAnthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nThomas' yardage numbers have slipped in the last two weeks, but he's still\nworth starting in Week 11 vs. Minnesota. The Vikings are giving up 124.3\nyards rushing per game, so look for the Bears to run Thomas early and\noften. \n\nDez White, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nWhite is dealing with a slight ankle injury, but he's expected to play\nagainst Minnesota. The Vikings secondary has been vulnerable to the pass\nthis season, so starting White in a deeper league is worth considering. \n\nIsaac Byrd, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nByrd will likely start in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad in Week 11\nagainst Atlanta. The Falcons pass defense is one of the worst units in the\nleague, so Byrd could actually put up some decent Fantasy numbers. \n\nWesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nWalls put up only two catches for 30 yards last weekend, but he did find\nthe end zone for the fifth time this season. Unless you've got a better\noption, starting Walls on a weekly basis is advisable. \n\nMaurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nSmith had a mediocre game last weekend vs. Green Bay, but he's likely to\nbounce back against Carolina. The Panthers have the worst run defense in\nthe league, so Smith should have no problem putting up solid Fantasy\nnumbers in Week 11. \n\nTony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nMartin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at all this season, but he\ncould have a decent outing against Carolina. The Panthers secondary is one\nof the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues\nmay be worth considering. \n\nFrank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nSanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on\nSunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary hasn't been playing well\nof late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is\nadvisable. \n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Teams, Player News                                         Luccis Losers |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nLuccis Losers Player News\n\nAlex Van Pelt, Reserve QB Updated 11/21/01\nVan Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a\nstrong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar\nSeahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this\nweek despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the\nbench for Week 11.\n\nCharlie Garner, Active RB Updated 11/21/01\nDon't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.\nTyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the\nrun. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.\n\nMike Alstott, Reserve RB Updated 11/21/01\nAlstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't\nexpect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,\nscoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. \n\nAz-Zahir Hakim, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01\nHakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New\nEngland. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,\nso avoid starting him if at all possible. \n\nCris Carter, Active WR Updated 11/21/01\nCarter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against\nthe Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should\nhave another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is\nranked last in the league. \n\nKurt Warner, Active QB Updated 11/21/01\nWarner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401\nyards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and\nwill throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent\nsecondary. \n\nJames McKnight, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01\nThere is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few\nlong passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep\nleagues.\n\nLarry Parker, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01\nParker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'\nsecondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He\nmight make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.\n\nDuce Staley, Active RB Updated 11/21/01\nStaley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in\nPhiladelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes\nhim worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. \n\nIke Hilliard, Active WR Updated 11/21/01\nHilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a\nsore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,\nhowever, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. \n\nCameron Cleeland, Reserve TE Updated 11/20/01\nCleeland (ankle) is doubtful for Sunday's game at New England. He'll likely\nbe replaced again by Boo Williams, who scored two touchdowns last week\nagainst Indianapolis. \n\nDonald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 11/20/01\nHayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He\nmay miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this\nweekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the\nleague, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11. \n\nRavens, Active DT Updated 11/20/01\nDefensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after\nundergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of\nthe Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage\nthan usual. \n\nMarty Booker, Active WR Updated 11/18/01\nBooker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his\nthird season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player\nyou must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. \n\nDavid Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00\nAkers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a\nfield goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this\nseason, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their\nbye week during some league's Fantasy championship game. \n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|        Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.       |\n|   Your site is always at http://football.fantasy.sportsline.com/getbad   |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nFB10SP\n<<<BODY END>>>",

His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch\na TD pass.\n\nJerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nThe loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis'\noutput over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him\nevery week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent\nTitans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats\nand may even find the end zone.\n\nCurtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nExpect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been\nvery soft all year long.\n\nKordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nWhile the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is\nstill far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a\nweak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use\nhim if you're desperate for a starter in your league.\n\nDarrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nJackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use\ntheir passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander,\nand Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.\n\nTim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nRaiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield\nin their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your\nactive lineup this week.\n\nCharlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nDon't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.\nTyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the\nrun. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.\n\nDavid Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nPatten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has\nbeen inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the\nwideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you\nshould consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.\n\nTroy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nBrown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has\nonly gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect\nanother solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.\n\nAntowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nSmith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season.\nHe'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we\nrecommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.\n\nOronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nGadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you\nuse him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you\nconsider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the\nseason.\n\nJames McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nThere is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few\nlong passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep\nleagues.\n\nTravis Minor, RB MIA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nThe Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the\ndefense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills\nhave been weak against the run all season.\n\nTony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nGonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While\nhe has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every\nweek.\n\nStephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nDavis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the\nend zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but\nyou may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running\nback depth around the league. \n\nLarry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nParker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'\nsecondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He\nmight make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.\n\nTony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nRichardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and\nthere's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas\nCity should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep\nleague or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your\nlineup.\n\nPriest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nThe Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday,\nwhich should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We\nrecommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against\nthe Jets in Week Nine.\n\nTrent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nGreen and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should\nrebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against\nthis questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less\nmistake-prone quarterback.\n\nStephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nAccording to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Alexander will be back in the\nstarting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent\nprior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a\ngamble. \n\nKyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nBrady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't\nrecommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this\nis the game he will break his slump.\n\nRod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nGardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some\ntrouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia\nsecondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective. \n\nKeenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nMcCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore,\nand that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at\nquarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat\nStarks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for\nexplosive stats.\n\nJimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nDespite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to\nkeep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less\nimpressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes\nthan most receivers in the league.\n\nElvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nThere's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing\nthe Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this\nweek if you have no other options at running back.\n\nMarcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nPollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance\nSchulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight\nend in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However,\nyou should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.\n\nTerrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nWilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday\nagainst San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way\nand post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend\nyou use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.\n\nMarvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nHarrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent.\nHowever, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer\ndownfield for great stats this week.\n\nDominic Rhodes, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nRhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should\ndefinitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats,\nbut should give good rushing totals and a score.\n\nDesmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nClark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in\nrecent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game\nThursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend\nthese two tight ends, if you need to start one it should definitely be\nClark.\n\nDwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nCarswell might factor into the Broncos' passing game more Thursday against\nDallas due to a thin corps at wide receiver. However, he had no catches in\nsimilar circumstances in Week 10, and the Cowboys will be ready to defend\nshort passes to him. Only use Carswell if you're thin at the tight end\nposition.\n\nKeith Poole, WR DEN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nIf Rod Smith indeed misses Thursday's game against Dallas, Poole will need\nto step up as the Broncos' top receiving target. However, we don't\nrecommend you use him in a Fantasy league until he first proves himself a\nreliable point-producer. Keep Poole reserved against Dallas.\n\nKevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nDon't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. he has been inconsistent\nthis season, and may not do much against a physical Pittsburgh defense.\n\nDerrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nMason should post respectable statistics against the Steelers. Don't expect\nhim to be intimidated by the Pittsburgh defense.\n\nMike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nAlstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't\nexpect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,\nscoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. \n\nBrad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nJohnson threw for 399 yards last week against Chicago, but he also threw no\ntouchdowns and was picked off twice. He's been unreliable from a Fantasy\nstandpoint, and is a gamble even when the matchup is in his favor. \n\nKeyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nJohnson had a big game against Chicago last weekend, catching 12 passes for\n89 yards. He was held out of the end zone again, but look for that to\nchange on Monday night against St. Louis. \n\nAz-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nHakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New\nEngland. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,\nso avoid starting him if at all possible. \n\nTorry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nHolt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last weekend against\nNew England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the league, and is\nworth starting on a weekly basis. \n\nIsaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nBruce had a huge game against New England last weekend, posting seven\ncatches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid game in Week 11 against\na Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big play. \n\nOlandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nGary will likely get a fair number of carries Thursday against Dallas, but\nwe don't expect him to provide useful Fantasy stats. The Cowboys will\nprobably focus on the run, which makes both Gary and Mike Anderson risky\nstarts this week since they have been splitting time.\n\nBrian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nWith favorite target Rod Smith likely sidelined by injury, Griese will have\nquestionable receivers to work with Thursday against Dallas. However, the\nCowboys' defense will probably focus on the run and force Griese to beat\nthem through the air. He should provide your team with decent stats and is\nworth using this week.\n\nMarshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nFaulk had 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against New England last\nweekend. He's the best player in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in\nany league format. \n\nJamel White, RB CLE - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nThe Browns may use White as a change-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar\nBengals run defense. You might want to consider him as a third running back\noption on your team if you're lacking in starting options.\n\nErnie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nConwell has had a few down weeks, and is now listed as questionable for\nMonday's game against Tampa Bay due to a shoulder injury. With the lack of\ndepth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is\nsomething many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do if he's\nhealthy. \n\nKurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nWarner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401\nyards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and\nwill throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent\nsecondary. \n\nO.J. Santiago, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nSantiago catches the occasional pass for the Browns and could find the end\nzone every now or then. He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati\nsecondary, so maybe this is one of the rare weeks he scores. Only use\nSantiago if you're desperate for a tight end, however, as he rarely gets a\nbig yardage total.\n\nKevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nJohnson has been a prime target for Tim Couch in the Cleveland passing game\nthis season, and is now a very reliable No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver.\nJohnson is on a real hot streak and has a good career record against the\nBengals, his opponent for this week, so get him into your lineup.\n\nTim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nCouch has a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards,\nfour TDs), whom he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks\nyou could choose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week,\ngive him a look.\n\nPeter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nWarrick has been catching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't\nprovided stats worthy of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league.\nHis matchup against Cleveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him\nreserved this week.\n\nDarnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nAlthough Scott has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last two games\nagainst the Browns, whom he plays Sunday, we can't recommend you use him\nthis week. He has been far too inconsistent and a real disappointment from\na Fantasy perspective.\n\nJon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nWe can't advise you use Kitna as he goes up against the Browns' secondary\nthis week. Cleveland has been very stingy against the pass all year,\nleading the league in interceptions and ranking ninth overall in sacks.\n\nCorey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01\nDefinitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the\nBrowns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678\nrushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in\nyour active lineup week in and week out in any league.\n\nLarry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nCenters has been a great pass-catching back for the Bills this season, but\nhe will face a Miami defense on Sunday that will likely be able to contain\nhim. Only use him if you have no other alternative on your bench.\n\nPeerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nPrice has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recent weeks,\nlogging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a bigger\nchallenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reserving him.\n\nEric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nThere's a good chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week\nagainst a solid Miami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent\nlimited role in the Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he\nhas a good history against the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and\nhe might be worth using as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.\n\nEric Johnson, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nJohnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against Carolina.\nUnless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't really worth\nstarting at this point. \n\nJ.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nStokes had a solid game last weekend, catching eight passes for 72 yards\nand two touchdowns against Carolina. He's been very unreliable overall,\nhowever, so starting him is still a risky move. \n\nTravis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nHenry had a very disappointing game against the Seahawks in Week 10, and\nwill likely struggle again against the far-better Dolphins defense on\nSunday. He has been far too inconsistent to merit using this week.\n\nAlex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nVan Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a\nstrong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar\nSeahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this\nweek despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the\nbench for Week 11.\n\nTravis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nAfter a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self.\nWe don't expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars, so\ndon't use him this week.\n\nShannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nSharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving\ntouchdown on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced\nJacksonville, and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe\ninto your active lineup every week.\n\nQadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nIsmail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly\ndeveloping into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot\nstreak and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you\nget Ismail into your starting lineup this week.\n\nCorrell Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nBuckhalter will return from suspension this weekend, and will be available\nfor Sunday's game against Washington. Duce Staley has established himself\nas the Eagles' featured back, so starting Buckhalter is a gamble. \n\nDuce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nStaley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in\nPhiladelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes\nhim worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. \n\nJames Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nJust when you think Thrash is reliable, he puts up two catches for 17 yards\nlike he did last weekend against Dallas. Thrash will still be in the\nstarting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams, but he's a gamble nonetheless. \n\nRon Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01\nDayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.\nHe may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for\nFantasy owners overall. \n\nTiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nBarber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a\ntouchdown in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run\nthis season, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their\noffense in Week 11. \n\nIke Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nHilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a\nsore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,\nhowever, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. \n\nAmani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nToomer caught five balls for 60 yards against Minnesota on Monday night,\nbut he'll struggle to post similar numbers vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a\nformidable secondary, so benching Toomer in smaller Fantasy leagues is a\nwise move. \n\nKerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01\nCollins had a solid game yardage-wise against Minnesota, throwing for 321\nyards on Monday night. However, he has had trouble getting the ball into\nthe end zone consistently, which makes him a risky Fantasy player. As a\nresult, benching him in Week 11 against Oakland is advisable. \n\nWillie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01\nJackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a Fantasy player, but he does\nhave the potential to post great numbers every week. If you play in a\ndeeper league, it's worth taking a gamble on Jackson against New England. \n\nJoe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nHorn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries, but he's been playing\nthrough them quite well. In fact, Horn has 14 catches for 247 yards and two\ntouchdowns in his last two games, and is a must-start in Week 11 against\nNew England based on his potential to post huge numbers. \n\nMichael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nBennett is proving all the critics right who said he wasn't ready for the\nNFL style of game. He's been a huge Fantasy disappointment and is barely\nworth a roster spot at this point. He'll do nothing against Chicago's\naggressive run defense, so don't bother starting him. \n\nDaunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nCulpepper finally had a breakout game last week, connecting on four\ntouchdown passes against the N.Y. Giants. He should have success against\nChicago's secondary on Sunday, so be sure to include him when you choose\nyour Week 11 starting lineup. \n\nCris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nCarter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against\nthe Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should\nhave another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is\nranked last in the league. \n\nJerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nThe Colts placed Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday with a damaged ligament\nin his right foot, effectively ending his season. He will undergo surgery\nin the near future, and you should cut him if you were holding onto him\nawaiting his return.\n\nTerry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nGlenn did not practice Tuesday or participate in the pre-practice\nwalkthrough on Wednesday, according to published reports. He is unlikely to\nplay Sunday against New Orleans and shouldn't be on anyone's Fantasy roster\nat this point.\n\nByron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nChamberlain locked up his right knee on Monday night against the N.Y.\nGiants, but he's expected to play this weekend vs. Chicago. Chamberlain has\nbeen unreliable of late, and getting open against Chicago's tough\nlinebacking group won't be an easy task. \n\nAhman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nGreen had a huge game against Detroit back in Week One, rushing for 157\nyards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 against those same\nLions, whose defense is questionable at best. \n\nBrett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nFavre had a somewhat rough outing last weekend, throwing three\ninterceptions against Atlanta. However, he's still one of the best Fantasy\nquarterbacks in the league, and he should bounce back on Thanksgiving\nagainst Detroit. \n\nAntonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nFreeman has been solid of late, catching four touchdown passes in his last\nfive games. He's a must start against Detroit's vulnerable pass defense in\nWeek 11. \n\nBubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nFranks has cooled off considerably in recent weeks, but his potential to\nfind the end zone still makes him a good Fantasy player. Unless you have a\nbetter option, starting Franks is advisable. \n\nBill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nSchroeder caught four passes for 55 yards and a touchdown last weekend\nagainst Atlanta. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy receivers in\nthe league, and should have a huge game vs. Detroit's weak secondary. \n\nCharlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nBatch had a huge game against Arizona last weekend, but he's been\ninconsistent this season for the most part. He's better off used when the\nmatchup is right, so facing a tough Green Bay defense may not bode well for\nhis Fantasy numbers.\n\nJohnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nMorton had a big game against Arizona last weekend, and has been a\nsurprisingly reliable Fantasy player this season. He may struggle against\nGreen Bay's tough pass defense, but he's still worth taking a gamble on in\nWeek 11. \n\nDesmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nHoward is not expected to miss an extended period of time due to his\nshoulder injury. He hasn't practitced this week, however, and is listed as\ndoubtful for Thursday's game against Green Bay. \n\nBert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nEmanuel, who suffered a sprained left knee during last weekend's game\nagainst Arizona, will miss at least four weeks of action. There was a\nchance that he'd be out for the season, but now he's expected to return in\nmid-to-late December. \n\nJames Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nStewart (ankle) practiced on Tuesday and feels as though he's ready to\nreturn to action. \"I feel pretty good,\" Stewart told the <I>Detroit Free\nPress</I>. \"It felt better than I thought. I'm just going to see, let (the\nmedical staff and coach Marty Mornhinweg) decide whether I play or not.\"\nHis carries may be down a bit in his first game back, but he's worth\nstarting in deeper leagues, barring any setbacks. \n\nTroy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nHambrick will return to fullback/backup duties on Thursday against Denver.\nWith Emmitt Smith expected to play, Hambrick isn't worth starting on your\nFantasy team in Week 11. \n\nJoey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nGalloway is a shell of his former self, catching only 24 passes through his\nfirst seven games this season. Dallas' pathetic quarterbacks have been the\nreal reason for Galloway's subpar numbers, making him a huge gamble from a\nFantasy perspective. Unless you're desperate, don't consider starting\nGalloway in Week 11. \n\nRaghib Ismail, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nIsmail has been Dallas' most consistent receiver, but starting him is still\na gamble from a Fantasy perspective. Dallas has the worst pass offense in\nthe league, so playing Ismail isn't advisable unless you're desperate. \n\nJim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nMiller put up solid numbers last weekend against Tampa Bay, throwing for\n228 yards and three touchdowns. Miller has been inconsistent this season,\nbut starting him in Week 11 against a shaky Minnesota secondary is\ndefinitely worth considering.\n\nAnthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nThomas' yardage numbers have slipped in the last two weeks, but he's still\nworth starting in Week 11 vs. Minnesota. The Vikings are giving up 124.3\nyards rushing per game, so look for the Bears to run Thomas early and\noften. \n\nDez White, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nWhite is dealing with a slight ankle injury, but he's expected to play\nagainst Minnesota. The Vikings secondary has been vulnerable to the pass\nthis season, so starting White in a deeper league is worth considering. \n\nIsaac Byrd, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nByrd will likely start in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad in Week 11\nagainst Atlanta. The Falcons pass defense is one of the worst units in the\nleague, so Byrd could actually put up some decent Fantasy numbers. \n\nWesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nWalls put up only two catches for 30 yards last weekend, but he did find\nthe end zone for the fifth time this season. Unless you've got a better\noption, starting Walls on a weekly basis is advisable. \n\nMaurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nSmith had a mediocre game last weekend vs. Green Bay, but he's likely to\nbounce back against Carolina. The Panthers have the worst run defense in\nthe league, so Smith should have no problem putting up solid Fantasy\nnumbers in Week 11. \n\nTony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nMartin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at all this season, but he\ncould have a decent outing against Carolina. The Panthers secondary is one\nof the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues\nmay be worth considering. \n\nFrank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nSanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on\nSunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary hasn't been playing well\nof late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is\nadvisable. \n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Teams, Player News                                         Luccis Losers |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nLuccis Losers Player News\n\nAlex Van Pelt, Reserve QB Updated 11/21/01\nVan Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a\nstrong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar\nSeahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this\nweek despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the\nbench for Week 11.\n\nCharlie Garner, Active RB Updated 11/21/01\nDon't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.\nTyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the\nrun. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.\n\nMike Alstott, Reserve RB Updated 11/21/01\nAlstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't\nexpect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,\nscoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. \n\nAz-Zahir Hakim, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01\nHakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New\nEngland. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,\nso avoid starting him if at all possible. \n\nCris Carter, Active WR Updated 11/21/01\nCarter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against\nthe Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should\nhave another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is\nranked last in the league. \n\nKurt Warner, Active QB Updated 11/21/01\nWarner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401\nyards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and\nwill throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent\nsecondary. \n\nJames McKnight, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01\nThere is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few\nlong passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep\nleagues.\n\nLarry Parker, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01\nParker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'\nsecondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He\nmight make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.\n\nDuce Staley, Active RB Updated 11/21/01\nStaley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in\nPhiladelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes\nhim worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. \n\nIke Hilliard, Active WR Updated 11/21/01\nHilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a\nsore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,\nhowever, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. \n\nCameron Cleeland, Reserve TE Updated 11/20/01\nCleeland (ankle) is doubtful for Sunday's game at New England. He'll likely\nbe replaced again by Boo Williams, who scored two touchdowns last week\nagainst Indianapolis. \n\nDonald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 11/20/01\nHayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He\nmay miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this\nweekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the\nleague, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11. \n\nRavens, Active DT Updated 11/20/01\nDefensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after\nundergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of\nthe Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage\nthan usual. \n\nMarty Booker, Active WR Updated 11/18/01\nBooker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his\nthird season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player\nyou must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. \n\nDavid Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00\nAkers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a\nfield goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this\nseason, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their\nbye week during some league's Fantasy championship game. \n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|        Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.       |\n|   Your site is always at http://football.fantasy.sportsline.com/getbad   |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nFB10SP\n",

This is the presentation that the Brattle Group---a consulting group=\n=20\nthat Edison has long used on gas issues in California---gave last week to t=\nhe=20\nlegislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the California=\n=20\nBorder.  The day following this presentation (which was followed by a=20\npresentation by the California PUC's FERC lawyer), the committee called El=\n=20\nPaso and Dynegy to respond to Brattle's and the CPUC FERC lawyer's=20\npresentations.  Also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that I've=\n=20\nseen in the press.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n***************************************************************************=\n***\n****************************************************\nCompeting evidence clouds Calif. investigation\n\nPrompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20\nCalifornia Assembly\nhas been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the=\n=20\nstate=01,s current\nenergy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane=\nd=20\nheavily on a\nreport prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility=\n=20\nSouthern California\nEdison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.\n\nBut the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu=\nral=20\nGas -- is not\nready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i=\nt=20\nrecently presented\nas evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.\n\nAs reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=\nUC=20\nare pointing\nthe finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=\nr=20\nprices through\naffiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =\nEl=20\nPaso is The Brattle\nGroup=01,s study of the California market.\n\nRichard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=\n=20\nof the\nCalifornia Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20\nGroup=01,s market\nstudy proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=\n=20\ncaused by normal\nmarket forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=\n=20\nwhich Assembly\nmembers questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=\n=20\nthe California\nmarket.\n\nEl Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=\nt=20\npresented to\nlegislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=\n=20\nof factors, not a\nconspiracy, caused the price run-up.\n\nLukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=\nso=20\nto conduct\nwork on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20\nconcluded that the\nincreasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=\n=20\nmain culprits in the\nCalifornia gas price imbroglio.\n\nAssemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=\n=20\nsaid he\n\"didn=01,t see any smoking gun\" in either report.\n\n\"We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20\nStudy and a little\non the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20\nlegislature is the best\nplace to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,\" Campbell=20\nsaid. \"I believe FERC\nis looking at this situation \" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=\n=20\nappropriate place.\"\n\nCampbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=\n=20\ngive support\nto its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. \"It=01,s being pushed=20\nbasically by the Public\nUtilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion\" by=20\npipeline companies to\npush up gas prices in California, he said.\n\nThe CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20\nassembly when\nit had failed on the federal level: \"There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=\nt on=20\nnatural gas but on other\nthings here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=\n=20\nfinger elsewhere for\nthe problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=\ng some=20\nof that with the\npublic utilities commission.\"\n\nWhether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20\nprices is a different\nmatter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=\nem=20\nto have taken\non a life of their own.\n\nThe Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=\n=20\nlitigated effort to\nforce FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20\nparticipants. Following\non a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=\n=20\nThe Brattle Group\nreport, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20\nmajor pipelines that\nserve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.\n\nSeveral parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=\n=20\nrequested data\ncontained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20\nprocess to move\nforward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=\n=20\naccess to evidence\n(GD 4/23).\n\nCritics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=\n=20\ncase. The commission\nrecently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=\n=20\nlarge block of\npipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20\naddressing the California\nAssembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=\ne=20\nCalifornia border\ncontroversy obviated the need for more investigation.\n\nThe controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=\n=20\nhearing into\nwhether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=\ne=20\nup the price of gas\ndelivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=\n=20\nthis summer. (RP00-\n241, et al.)

This is the presentation that the Brattle Group---a consulting group=\n=20\nthat Edison has long used on gas issues in California---gave last week to t=\nhe=20\nlegislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the California=\n=20\nBorder.  The day following this presentation (which was followed by a=20\npresentation by the California PUC's FERC lawyer), the committee called El=\n=20\nPaso and Dynegy to respond to Brattle's and the CPUC FERC lawyer's=20\npresentations.  Also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that I've=\n=20\nseen in the press.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n***************************************************************************=\n***\n****************************************************\nCompeting evidence clouds Calif. investigation\n\nPrompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20\nCalifornia Assembly\nhas been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the=\n=20\nstate=01,s current\nenergy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane=\nd=20\nheavily on a\nreport prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility=\n=20\nSouthern California\nEdison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.\n\nBut the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu=\nral=20\nGas -- is not\nready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i=\nt=20\nrecently presented\nas evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.\n\nAs reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=\nUC=20\nare pointing\nthe finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=\nr=20\nprices through\naffiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =\nEl=20\nPaso is The Brattle\nGroup=01,s study of the California market.\n\nRichard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=\n=20\nof the\nCalifornia Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20\nGroup=01,s market\nstudy proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=\n=20\ncaused by normal\nmarket forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=\n=20\nwhich Assembly\nmembers questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=\n=20\nthe California\nmarket.\n\nEl Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=\nt=20\npresented to\nlegislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=\n=20\nof factors, not a\nconspiracy, caused the price run-up.\n\nLukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=\nso=20\nto conduct\nwork on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20\nconcluded that the\nincreasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=\n=20\nmain culprits in the\nCalifornia gas price imbroglio.\n\nAssemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=\n=20\nsaid he\n\"didn=01,t see any smoking gun\" in either report.\n\n\"We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20\nStudy and a little\non the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20\nlegislature is the best\nplace to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,\" Campbell=20\nsaid. \"I believe FERC\nis looking at this situation \" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=\n=20\nappropriate place.\"\n\nCampbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=\n=20\ngive support\nto its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. \"It=01,s being pushed=20\nbasically by the Public\nUtilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion\" by=20\npipeline companies to\npush up gas prices in California, he said.\n\nThe CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20\nassembly when\nit had failed on the federal level: \"There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=\nt on=20\nnatural gas but on other\nthings here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=\n=20\nfinger elsewhere for\nthe problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=\ng some=20\nof that with the\npublic utilities commission.\"\n\nWhether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20\nprices is a different\nmatter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=\nem=20\nto have taken\non a life of their own.\n\nThe Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=\n=20\nlitigated effort to\nforce FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20\nparticipants. Following\non a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=\n=20\nThe Brattle Group\nreport, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20\nmajor pipelines that\nserve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.\n\nSeveral parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=\n=20\nrequested data\ncontained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20\nprocess to move\nforward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=\n=20\naccess to evidence\n(GD 4/23).\n\nCritics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=\n=20\ncase. The commission\nrecently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=\n=20\nlarge block of\npipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20\naddressing the California\nAssembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=\ne=20\nCalifornia border\ncontroversy obviated the need for more investigation.\n\nThe controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=\n=20\nhearing into\nwhether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=\ne=20\nup the price of gas\ndelivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=\n=20\nthis summer. (RP00-\n241, et al.)

According to \nSteve, who will probably not be at this meeting since his name is now on the \n\"official list\", these are the outstanding items:\n\nI have offiered $5000 finders fee per person, Phil would like more.  Our \neconomic analysis assumed a $10k finders fee, so we are still within that \nlimit.\nEDS definitely wants the contract minimums for 2001 and 2002 increased.  I \nwill offer $8mm for both years, an increase of $2mm in 2001 and $3mm in \n2002.  Again, I want to stress to them that they must EARN this additional \nwork.  I am still playing phone tag with Ken Stott on this to see what Azurix \nplans for 2001 and 2002.  \n\nOur orginal plan, which was quite agressive, targeted 4/1 as the transition \ndate.  GIven that we are in the second week of March, I think a more \nrealistic timeline for transition is 5/1.  This means the employee offers \nshould be out no later than 4/1, with a yes/no answer back by 4/15.  Then \nactual transition of the \"yes\" employees will take place effective 5/1.  I \nthink our initial \"yes\" response will be at 75%, but by the time 4/15 hits, \nthat amount will be 90-95%.  In discussions with Steve, he thinks this is a \nrealistic guess.\n\nSo, the next steps include:\nFinishing up negotiations with EDS/Phil Clark.\nStart developing a transition workplan/communication plan with HR (Robert \nJones and Ben Herman).\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.  I'll provide another update \nafter my meeting on Wednesday.\n\nThanks.   Jenny\n",

The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. \nUnder the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. \nFurther terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. \nMEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, \"We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.\" \nRegent President John Ehrman said, \"The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.\" \nThe producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. \nRecently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.\n",

His yardage numbers should be respectable, and he may catch\na TD pass.\n\nJerome Bettis, RB PIT - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nThe loss of tight end Mark Bruener could have an adverse impact on Bettis'\noutput over the final weeks of the season, but you still need to start him\nevery week in your league. Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent\nTitans rush defense on Sunday, but he'll still give you serviceable stats\nand may even find the end zone.\n\nCurtis Conway, WR SD - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nExpect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense has been\nvery soft all year long.\n\nKordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nWhile the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent weeks, Stewart is\nstill far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis. He faces a\nweak Tennessee secondary on Sunday, which is a good matchup, but only use\nhim if you're desperate for a starter in your league.\n\nDarrell Jackson, WR SEA - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nJackson should play very well at Kansas City this week. Seattle will use\ntheir passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander,\nand Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck.\n\nTim Brown, WR OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nRaiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield\nin their game against the Giants on Sunday. Definitely get Brown into your\nactive lineup this week.\n\nCharlie Garner, RB OAK - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nDon't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.\nTyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the\nrun. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.\n\nDavid Patten, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nPatten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has\nbeen inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the\nwideout. Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you\nshould consider using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.\n\nTroy Brown, WR NE - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nBrown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season, and has\nonly gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball. Expect\nanother solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary.\n\nAntowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nSmith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season.\nHe'll go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday, and we\nrecommend you get him into your active lineup as a result.\n\nOronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nGadsden has been very inconsistent this season, and we don't recommend you\nuse him this week against the Bills. Let him prove himself before you\nconsider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the\nseason.\n\nJames McKnight, WR MIA - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nThere is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few\nlong passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep\nleagues.\n\nTravis Minor, RB MIA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nThe Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the\ndefense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills\nhave been weak against the run all season.\n\nTony Gonzalez, TE KC - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nGonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. While\nhe has been somewhat of a disappointment, you need to keep him active every\nweek.\n\nStephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nDavis rushed for 84 yards against Denver last week, and was held out of the\nend zone once again. He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week 11, but\nyou may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running\nback depth around the league. \n\nLarry Parker, WR KC - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nParker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'\nsecondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He\nmight make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.\n\nTony Richardson, RB KC - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nRichardson has fallen into a goal-line back role in recent games, and\nthere's a chance he'll get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday. Kansas\nCity should move the ball with relative ease, and if you are in a deep\nleague or a touchdown-only league, he might be worth putting in your\nlineup.\n\nPriest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nThe Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday,\nwhich should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week. We\nrecommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against\nthe Jets in Week Nine.\n\nTrent Green, QB KC - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nGreen and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week, but should\nrebound Sunday against Seattle. Expect him to post decent stats against\nthis questionable secondary, but don't rush to start him over a less\nmistake-prone quarterback.\n\nStephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nAccording to the <I>Washington Post</I>, Alexander will be back in the\nstarting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia. He had been inconsistent\nprior to suffering an ankle injury, so starting him is somewhat of a\ngamble. \n\nKyle Brady, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nBrady hasn't offered useful Fantasy stats much this season. We don't\nrecommend you use him this week against the Ravens, as it is unlikely this\nis the game he will break his slump.\n\nRod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nGardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks, and is having some\ntrouble holding onto the ball recently. He'll face a tough Philadelphia\nsecondary on Sunday, making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective. \n\nKeenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nMcCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday's game against Baltimore,\nand that, combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at\nquarterback, makes him a risky start. McCardell has the talent to beat\nStarks for a few good catches, but you shouldn't be counting on him for\nexplosive stats.\n\nJimmy Smith, WR JAC - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nDespite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game, you have to\nkeep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league. He might have less\nimpressive stats, but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes\nthan most receivers in the league.\n\nElvis Joseph, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nThere's a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing\nthe Ravens' defense on Sunday. However, we only recommend you use him this\nweek if you have no other options at running back.\n\nMarcus Pollard, TE IND - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nPollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco's Lance\nSchulters on Sunday. While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight\nend in recent weeks, you shouldn't expect great stats this week. However,\nyou should probably start him unless you have a good alternative.\n\nTerrence Wilkins, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nWilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday\nagainst San Francisco. While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way\nand post decent stats against a so-so Niners secondary, we only recommend\nyou use him if you have no other options at wide receiver.\n\nMarvin Harrison, WR IND - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nHarrison is a must-start in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent.\nHowever, he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer\ndownfield for great stats this week.\n\nDominic Rhodes, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nRhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday, and you should\ndefinitely start him this week. He may not post Edgerrin James-like stats,\nbut should give good rushing totals and a score.\n\nDesmond Clark, TE DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nClark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in\nrecent weeks, and he will be a key member of the Broncos' passing game\nThursday against Dallas. While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend\nthese two tight ends, if you need to start one it should definitely be\nClark.\n\nDwayne Carswell, TE DEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nCarswell might factor into the Broncos' passing game more Thursday against\nDallas due to a thin corps at wide receiver. However, he had no catches in\nsimilar circumstances in Week 10, and the Cowboys will be ready to defend\nshort passes to him. Only use Carswell if you're thin at the tight end\nposition.\n\nKeith Poole, WR DEN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nIf Rod Smith indeed misses Thursday's game against Dallas, Poole will need\nto step up as the Broncos' top receiving target. However, we don't\nrecommend you use him in a Fantasy league until he first proves himself a\nreliable point-producer. Keep Poole reserved against Dallas.\n\nKevin Dyson, WR TEN - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nDon't look for good numbers from Dyson this week. he has been inconsistent\nthis season, and may not do much against a physical Pittsburgh defense.\n\nDerrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nMason should post respectable statistics against the Steelers. Don't expect\nhim to be intimidated by the Pittsburgh defense.\n\nMike Alstott, RB TB - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nAlstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't\nexpect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,\nscoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. \n\nBrad Johnson, QB TB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nJohnson threw for 399 yards last week against Chicago, but he also threw no\ntouchdowns and was picked off twice. He's been unreliable from a Fantasy\nstandpoint, and is a gamble even when the matchup is in his favor. \n\nKeyshawn Johnson, WR TB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nJohnson had a big game against Chicago last weekend, catching 12 passes for\n89 yards. He was held out of the end zone again, but look for that to\nchange on Monday night against St. Louis. \n\nAz-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nHakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New\nEngland. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,\nso avoid starting him if at all possible. \n\nTorry Holt, WR STL - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nHolt had seven receptions for 89 yards and a touchdown last weekend against\nNew England. He's one of the better Fantasy receivers in the league, and is\nworth starting on a weekly basis. \n\nIsaac Bruce, WR STL - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nBruce had a huge game against New England last weekend, posting seven\ncatches for 130 yards. Look for him to have a solid game in Week 11 against\na Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big play. \n\nOlandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nGary will likely get a fair number of carries Thursday against Dallas, but\nwe don't expect him to provide useful Fantasy stats. The Cowboys will\nprobably focus on the run, which makes both Gary and Mike Anderson risky\nstarts this week since they have been splitting time.\n\nBrian Griese, QB DEN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nWith favorite target Rod Smith likely sidelined by injury, Griese will have\nquestionable receivers to work with Thursday against Dallas. However, the\nCowboys' defense will probably focus on the run and force Griese to beat\nthem through the air. He should provide your team with decent stats and is\nworth using this week.\n\nMarshall Faulk, RB STL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nFaulk had 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against New England last\nweekend. He's the best player in Fantasy Football, and is a must-start in\nany league format. \n\nJamel White, RB CLE - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nThe Browns may use White as a change-of-pace back Sunday against the subpar\nBengals run defense. You might want to consider him as a third running back\noption on your team if you're lacking in starting options.\n\nErnie Conwell, TE STL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nConwell has had a few down weeks, and is now listed as questionable for\nMonday's game against Tampa Bay due to a shoulder injury. With the lack of\ndepth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is\nsomething many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do if he's\nhealthy. \n\nKurt Warner, QB STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nWarner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401\nyards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and\nwill throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent\nsecondary. \n\nO.J. Santiago, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nSantiago catches the occasional pass for the Browns and could find the end\nzone every now or then. He's going up against a mediocre Cincinnati\nsecondary, so maybe this is one of the rare weeks he scores. Only use\nSantiago if you're desperate for a tight end, however, as he rarely gets a\nbig yardage total.\n\nKevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nJohnson has been a prime target for Tim Couch in the Cleveland passing game\nthis season, and is now a very reliable No. 2 or 3 Fantasy receiver.\nJohnson is on a real hot streak and has a good career record against the\nBengals, his opponent for this week, so get him into your lineup.\n\nTim Couch, QB CLE - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nCouch has a decent track record against the Bengals (453 passing yards,\nfour TDs), whom he will face on Sunday. There are plenty worse quarterbacks\nyou could choose from, so if you're reaching to find a starter this week,\ngive him a look.\n\nPeter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nWarrick has been catching a fair amount of passes this season, but hasn't\nprovided stats worthy of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league.\nHis matchup against Cleveland on Sunday is unfavorable, so keep him\nreserved this week.\n\nDarnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nAlthough Scott has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last two games\nagainst the Browns, whom he plays Sunday, we can't recommend you use him\nthis week. He has been far too inconsistent and a real disappointment from\na Fantasy perspective.\n\nJon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nWe can't advise you use Kitna as he goes up against the Browns' secondary\nthis week. Cleveland has been very stingy against the pass all year,\nleading the league in interceptions and ranking ninth overall in sacks.\n\nCorey Dillon, RB CIN - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01\nDefinitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the\nBrowns on Sunday. He has a great career record against Cleveland (678\nrushing yards, five rushing TDs in five games). Dillon should remain in\nyour active lineup week in and week out in any league.\n\nLarry Centers, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nCenters has been a great pass-catching back for the Bills this season, but\nhe will face a Miami defense on Sunday that will likely be able to contain\nhim. Only use him if you have no other alternative on your bench.\n\nPeerless Price, WR BUF - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nPrice has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recent weeks,\nlogging 100-plus yards in three of his last six games. He faces a bigger\nchallenge in Miami on Sunday, but right now you can't merit reserving him.\n\nEric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nThere's a good chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week\nagainst a solid Miami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent\nlimited role in the Buffalo passing game. Pair that with the fact that he\nhas a good history against the Dolphins (four TDs in last six games), and\nhe might be worth using as a No. 2 or 3 receiver this week.\n\nEric Johnson, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nJohnson caught three passes for 34 yards last weekend against Carolina.\nUnless you play in a deeper Fantasy league, Johnson isn't really worth\nstarting at this point. \n\nJ.J. Stokes, WR SF - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nStokes had a solid game last weekend, catching eight passes for 72 yards\nand two touchdowns against Carolina. He's been very unreliable overall,\nhowever, so starting him is still a risky move. \n\nTravis Henry, RB BUF - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nHenry had a very disappointing game against the Seahawks in Week 10, and\nwill likely struggle again against the far-better Dolphins defense on\nSunday. He has been far too inconsistent to merit using this week.\n\nAlex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nVan Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a\nstrong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar\nSeahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this\nweek despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the\nbench for Week 11.\n\nTravis Taylor, WR BAL - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nAfter a few solid weeks, Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self.\nWe don't expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars, so\ndon't use him this week.\n\nShannon Sharpe, TE BAL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nSharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving\ntouchdown on the season. He got seven catches the last time he faced\nJacksonville, and should get several in their Week 11 matchup. Get Sharpe\ninto your active lineup every week.\n\nQadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nIsmail has become the Ravens' lead receiver this season, and is quickly\ndeveloping into a very reliable No. 2 Fantasy wideout. He is on a real hot\nstreak and has a good history against the Jaguars' secondary. Make sure you\nget Ismail into your starting lineup this week.\n\nCorrell Buckhalter, RB PHI - Uran Man Updated 11/21/01\nBuckhalter will return from suspension this weekend, and will be available\nfor Sunday's game against Washington. Duce Staley has established himself\nas the Eagles' featured back, so starting Buckhalter is a gamble. \n\nDuce Staley, RB PHI - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nStaley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in\nPhiladelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes\nhim worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. \n\nJames Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nJust when you think Thrash is reliable, he puts up two catches for 17 yards\nlike he did last weekend against Dallas. Thrash will still be in the\nstarting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams, but he's a gamble nonetheless. \n\nRon Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01\nDayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks.\nHe may score a touchdown in goal-line situations, but he's a risky pick for\nFantasy owners overall. \n\nTiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nBarber has played well recently, compiling 233 scrimmage yards and a\ntouchdown in his last two games. Oakland has been vulnerable to the run\nthis season, so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their\noffense in Week 11. \n\nIke Hilliard, WR NYG - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nHilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a\nsore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,\nhowever, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. \n\nAmani Toomer, WR NYG - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nToomer caught five balls for 60 yards against Minnesota on Monday night,\nbut he'll struggle to post similar numbers vs. Oakland. The Raiders have a\nformidable secondary, so benching Toomer in smaller Fantasy leagues is a\nwise move. \n\nKerry Collins, QB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01\nCollins had a solid game yardage-wise against Minnesota, throwing for 321\nyards on Monday night. However, he has had trouble getting the ball into\nthe end zone consistently, which makes him a risky Fantasy player. As a\nresult, benching him in Week 11 against Oakland is advisable. \n\nWillie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/21/01\nJackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a Fantasy player, but he does\nhave the potential to post great numbers every week. If you play in a\ndeeper league, it's worth taking a gamble on Jackson against New England. \n\nJoe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nHorn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries, but he's been playing\nthrough them quite well. In fact, Horn has 14 catches for 247 yards and two\ntouchdowns in his last two games, and is a must-start in Week 11 against\nNew England based on his potential to post huge numbers. \n\nMichael Bennett, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nBennett is proving all the critics right who said he wasn't ready for the\nNFL style of game. He's been a huge Fantasy disappointment and is barely\nworth a roster spot at this point. He'll do nothing against Chicago's\naggressive run defense, so don't bother starting him. \n\nDaunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nCulpepper finally had a breakout game last week, connecting on four\ntouchdown passes against the N.Y. Giants. He should have success against\nChicago's secondary on Sunday, so be sure to include him when you choose\nyour Week 11 starting lineup. \n\nCris Carter, WR MIN - Luccis Losers Updated 11/21/01\nCarter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against\nthe Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should\nhave another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is\nranked last in the league. \n\nJerome Pathon, WR IND - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nThe Colts placed Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday with a damaged ligament\nin his right foot, effectively ending his season. He will undergo surgery\nin the near future, and you should cut him if you were holding onto him\nawaiting his return.\n\nTerry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nGlenn did not practice Tuesday or participate in the pre-practice\nwalkthrough on Wednesday, according to published reports. He is unlikely to\nplay Sunday against New Orleans and shouldn't be on anyone's Fantasy roster\nat this point.\n\nByron Chamberlain, TE MIN - Really Rottens Updated 11/21/01\nChamberlain locked up his right knee on Monday night against the N.Y.\nGiants, but he's expected to play this weekend vs. Chicago. Chamberlain has\nbeen unreliable of late, and getting open against Chicago's tough\nlinebacking group won't be an easy task. \n\nAhman Green, RB GB - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nGreen had a huge game against Detroit back in Week One, rushing for 157\nyards and two touchdowns. He's a must-start in Week 11 against those same\nLions, whose defense is questionable at best. \n\nBrett Favre, QB GB - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nFavre had a somewhat rough outing last weekend, throwing three\ninterceptions against Atlanta. However, he's still one of the best Fantasy\nquarterbacks in the league, and he should bounce back on Thanksgiving\nagainst Detroit. \n\nAntonio Freeman, WR GB - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/21/01\nFreeman has been solid of late, catching four touchdown passes in his last\nfive games. He's a must start against Detroit's vulnerable pass defense in\nWeek 11. \n\nBubba Franks, TE GB - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nFranks has cooled off considerably in recent weeks, but his potential to\nfind the end zone still makes him a good Fantasy player. Unless you have a\nbetter option, starting Franks is advisable. \n\nBill Schroeder, WR GB - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nSchroeder caught four passes for 55 yards and a touchdown last weekend\nagainst Atlanta. He's been one of the more reliable Fantasy receivers in\nthe league, and should have a huge game vs. Detroit's weak secondary. \n\nCharlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/21/01\nBatch had a huge game against Arizona last weekend, but he's been\ninconsistent this season for the most part. He's better off used when the\nmatchup is right, so facing a tough Green Bay defense may not bode well for\nhis Fantasy numbers.\n\nJohnnie Morton, WR DET - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nMorton had a big game against Arizona last weekend, and has been a\nsurprisingly reliable Fantasy player this season. He may struggle against\nGreen Bay's tough pass defense, but he's still worth taking a gamble on in\nWeek 11. \n\nDesmond Howard, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nHoward is not expected to miss an extended period of time due to his\nshoulder injury. He hasn't practitced this week, however, and is listed as\ndoubtful for Thursday's game against Green Bay. \n\nBert Emanuel, WR DET - Blue Balls Updated 11/21/01\nEmanuel, who suffered a sprained left knee during last weekend's game\nagainst Arizona, will miss at least four weeks of action. There was a\nchance that he'd be out for the season, but now he's expected to return in\nmid-to-late December. \n\nJames Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/21/01\nStewart (ankle) practiced on Tuesday and feels as though he's ready to\nreturn to action. \"I feel pretty good,\" Stewart told the <I>Detroit Free\nPress</I>. \"It felt better than I thought. I'm just going to see, let (the\nmedical staff and coach Marty Mornhinweg) decide whether I play or not.\"\nHis carries may be down a bit in his first game back, but he's worth\nstarting in deeper leagues, barring any setbacks. \n\nTroy Hambrick, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nHambrick will return to fullback/backup duties on Thursday against Denver.\nWith Emmitt Smith expected to play, Hambrick isn't worth starting on your\nFantasy team in Week 11. \n\nJoey Galloway, WR DAL - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nGalloway is a shell of his former self, catching only 24 passes through his\nfirst seven games this season. Dallas' pathetic quarterbacks have been the\nreal reason for Galloway's subpar numbers, making him a huge gamble from a\nFantasy perspective. Unless you're desperate, don't consider starting\nGalloway in Week 11. \n\nRaghib Ismail, WR DAL - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/21/01\nIsmail has been Dallas' most consistent receiver, but starting him is still\na gamble from a Fantasy perspective. Dallas has the worst pass offense in\nthe league, so playing Ismail isn't advisable unless you're desperate. \n\nJim Miller, QB CHI - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/21/01\nMiller put up solid numbers last weekend against Tampa Bay, throwing for\n228 yards and three touchdowns. Miller has been inconsistent this season,\nbut starting him in Week 11 against a shaky Minnesota secondary is\ndefinitely worth considering.\n\nAnthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nThomas' yardage numbers have slipped in the last two weeks, but he's still\nworth starting in Week 11 vs. Minnesota. The Vikings are giving up 124.3\nyards rushing per game, so look for the Bears to run Thomas early and\noften. \n\nDez White, WR CHI - President Taft Updated 11/21/01\nWhite is dealing with a slight ankle injury, but he's expected to play\nagainst Minnesota. The Vikings secondary has been vulnerable to the pass\nthis season, so starting White in a deeper league is worth considering. \n\nIsaac Byrd, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01\nByrd will likely start in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad in Week 11\nagainst Atlanta. The Falcons pass defense is one of the worst units in the\nleague, so Byrd could actually put up some decent Fantasy numbers. \n\nWesley Walls, TE CAR - Team Chick Updated 11/21/01\nWalls put up only two catches for 30 yards last weekend, but he did find\nthe end zone for the fifth time this season. Unless you've got a better\noption, starting Walls on a weekly basis is advisable. \n\nMaurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nSmith had a mediocre game last weekend vs. Green Bay, but he's likely to\nbounce back against Carolina. The Panthers have the worst run defense in\nthe league, so Smith should have no problem putting up solid Fantasy\nnumbers in Week 11. \n\nTony Martin, WR ATL - Team Dick Updated 11/21/01\nMartin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at all this season, but he\ncould have a decent outing against Carolina. The Panthers secondary is one\nof the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues\nmay be worth considering. \n\nFrank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/21/01\nSanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on\nSunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary hasn't been playing well\nof late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is\nadvisable. \n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Teams, Player News                                         Luccis Losers |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nLuccis Losers Player News\n\nAlex Van Pelt, Reserve QB Updated 11/21/01\nVan Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday, as he is going up against a\nstrong Dolphins secondary. He had a good start last week against the subpar\nSeahawks, but we don't forecast him helping carry your team to victory this\nweek despite several injuries to the Miami defense. Keep Van Pelt on the\nbench for Week 11.\n\nCharlie Garner, Active RB Updated 11/21/01\nDon't expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday.\nTyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the\nrun. Only use Garner if you don't have another alternative on your roster.\n\nMike Alstott, Reserve RB Updated 11/21/01\nAlstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn, so don't\nexpect huge Fantasy numbers from him. Unless you play in a deeper,\nscoring-based league, starting Alstott is a risk. \n\nAz-Zahir Hakim, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01\nHakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday's game against New\nEngland. He's listed as questionable for Monday's game against Tampa Bay,\nso avoid starting him if at all possible. \n\nCris Carter, Active WR Updated 11/21/01\nCarter had 10 catches for 46 yards and a touchdown on Monday night against\nthe Giants, proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player. He should\nhave another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago, whose pass defense is\nranked last in the league. \n\nKurt Warner, Active QB Updated 11/21/01\nWarner had a solid game against New England last Sunday, throwing for 401\nyards and three touchdowns. He's too good to ever consider benching, and\nwill throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay's inconsistent\nsecondary. \n\nJames McKnight, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01\nThere is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few\nlong passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep\nleagues.\n\nLarry Parker, Reserve WR Updated 11/21/01\nParker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle, as the Seahawks'\nsecondary has regularly been burned by teams' second wideout options. He\nmight make a good No. 3 receiver for this week.\n\nDuce Staley, Active RB Updated 11/21/01\nStaley had a solid game against Dallas, posting 133 scrimmage yards in\nPhiladelphia's 36-3 win. He's been on a roll in recent weeks, which makes\nhim worth starting in Week 11 against Washington. \n\nIke Hilliard, Active WR Updated 11/21/01\nHilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a\nsore toe. He may have a tough time against Oakland's formidable secondary,\nhowever, especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play. \n\nCameron Cleeland, Reserve TE Updated 11/20/01\nCleeland (ankle) is doubtful for Sunday's game at New England. He'll likely\nbe replaced again by Boo Williams, who scored two touchdowns last week\nagainst Indianapolis. \n\nDonald Hayes, Reserve WR Updated 11/20/01\nHayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He\nmay miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this\nweekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the\nleague, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11. \n\nRavens, Active DT Updated 11/20/01\nDefensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after\nundergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of\nthe Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage\nthan usual. \n\nMarty Booker, Active WR Updated 11/18/01\nBooker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his\nthird season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player\nyou must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. \n\nDavid Akers, Active K Updated 12/11/00\nAkers was 5-of-5 in PATs on Sunday, but didn't get an opportunity to kick a\nfield goal against the Browns. Akers has been a real Fantasy sleeper this\nseason, but won't do owners much good next week as the Eagles take their\nbye week during some league's Fantasy championship game. \n\n\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n|        Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.       |\n|   Your site is always at http://football.fantasy.sportsline.com/getbad   |\n+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\nFB10SP\n",

This is the presentation that the Brattle Group---a consulting group=\n=20\nthat Edison has long used on gas issues in California---gave last week to t=\nhe=20\nlegislative committee investigating wholesale gas prices at the California=\n=20\nBorder.  The day following this presentation (which was followed by a=20\npresentation by the California PUC's FERC lawyer), the committee called El=\n=20\nPaso and Dynegy to respond to Brattle's and the CPUC FERC lawyer's=20\npresentations.  Also attached is the best synopsis of the hearing that I've=\n=20\nseen in the press.\n\nBest,\nJeff\n***************************************************************************=\n***\n****************************************************\nCompeting evidence clouds Calif. investigation\n\nPrompted in part by the California Public Utilities Commission, the=20\nCalifornia Assembly\nhas been scrutinizing the role that interstate pipelines have played in the=\n=20\nstate=01,s current\nenergy crisis. In the efforts to find a smoking gun, legislators have leane=\nd=20\nheavily on a\nreport prepared by The Brattle Group, a consultancy commissioned by utility=\n=20\nSouthern California\nEdison to dig up evidence of market power abuse.\n\nBut the state=01,s biggest transporter of gas to California -- El Paso Natu=\nral=20\nGas -- is not\nready to take the rap. The pipeline has commissioned its own study, which i=\nt=20\nrecently presented\nas evidence that it has not circumvented any laws or regulation.\n\nAs reported in both the trade press and national media, SoCal Ed and the CP=\nUC=20\nare pointing\nthe finger of blame at El Paso for alleged manipulation of California borde=\nr=20\nprices through\naffiliate deals and capacity hoarding. And exhibit A in their case against =\nEl=20\nPaso is The Brattle\nGroup=01,s study of the California market.\n\nRichard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=\n=20\nof the\nCalifornia Assembly Judiciary Committee, told Gas Daily that The Brattle=20\nGroup=01,s market\nstudy proved that the surge in gas prices at the California border was not=\n=20\ncaused by normal\nmarket forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=\n=20\nwhich Assembly\nmembers questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=\n=20\nthe California\nmarket.\n\nEl Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=\nt=20\npresented to\nlegislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=\n=20\nof factors, not a\nconspiracy, caused the price run-up.\n\nLukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=\nso=20\nto conduct\nwork on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20\nconcluded that the\nincreasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=\n=20\nmain culprits in the\nCalifornia gas price imbroglio.\n\nAssemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=\n=20\nsaid he\n\"didn=01,t see any smoking gun\" in either report.\n\n\"We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20\nStudy and a little\non the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20\nlegislature is the best\nplace to adjudicate the differences between these two studies,\" Campbell=20\nsaid. \"I believe FERC\nis looking at this situation \" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=\n=20\nappropriate place.\"\n\nCampbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=\n=20\ngive support\nto its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. \"It=01,s being pushed=20\nbasically by the Public\nUtilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion\" by=20\npipeline companies to\npush up gas prices in California, he said.\n\nThe CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20\nassembly when\nit had failed on the federal level: \"There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=\nt on=20\nnatural gas but on other\nthings here in California, for entities and organizations here to point the=\n=20\nfinger elsewhere for\nthe problems that we=01,re having in this state and I think you=01,re seein=\ng some=20\nof that with the\npublic utilities commission.\"\n\nWhether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20\nprices is a different\nmatter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=\nem=20\nto have taken\non a life of their own.\n\nThe Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=\n=20\nlitigated effort to\nforce FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20\nparticipants. Following\non a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=\n=20\nThe Brattle Group\nreport, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20\nmajor pipelines that\nserve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.\n\nSeveral parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=\n=20\nrequested data\ncontained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20\nprocess to move\nforward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=\n=20\naccess to evidence\n(GD 4/23).\n\nCritics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=\n=20\ncase. The commission\nrecently dismissed the CPUC=01,s claim that El Paso rigged the auction of a=\n=20\nlarge block of\npipeline capacity in favor of affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. In=20\naddressing the California\nAssembly, representatives of Dynegy said that FERC=01,s recent ruling on th=\ne=20\nCalifornia border\ncontroversy obviated the need for more investigation.\n\nThe controversy, however, is far from over. FERC last month also ordered a=\n=20\nhearing into\nwhether El Paso Natural Gas and its affiliates manipulated capacity to driv=\ne=20\nup the price of gas\ndelivered into California (GD 3/29). That hearing is likely to take place=\n=20\nthis summer. (RP00-\n241, et al.)
